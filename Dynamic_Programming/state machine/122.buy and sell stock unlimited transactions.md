As long as the prev price is lower than curr price, make the transaction.
- treat the smaller prev price as the purchase price and the current price as the sell price

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int ans = 0, len = prices.size();
    for (int i=1; i<len; ++i){
        if (prices[i] > prices[i-1])
            ans += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
    }
    return ans;
}
```
