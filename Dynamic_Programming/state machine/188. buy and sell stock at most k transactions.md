- if k > len/2, meaning we can complete as many transactions as possible since it takes 2 days to complete each transaction
- else, use the state machine to update each transaction's amount at each price
    - for the current price to be used as the current state, all of the states before the current state must have happened before the current price
    
```cpp
int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
    if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
    int len = prices.size();
    if (k>len/2){ // simple case
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<len; ++i){
            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1])
                ans += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        }
        return ans;
    }
    //each index in the array is used as the ith transaction
    vector<int>sell(k+1, 0); 
    vector<int>buy(k+1, INT_MAX);
    int maxprofit = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){
        for (int j = k; j >= 1; j--){
            sell[j] = max(sell[j], prices[i] - buy[j]); //max the profit by using curr price as the sale and the prev min price
            buy[j] = min(buy[j], prices[i]-sell[j-1]); //the purchase price for curr is smallest when prev profit is the largest 
            maxprofit = max(maxprofit, sell[j]);
        }
    }
    return maxprofit;
}
```
