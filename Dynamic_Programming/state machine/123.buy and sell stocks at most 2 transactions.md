State machine is used.
- a second transaction at the current price can only happen if the first transaction already occurred before.
- a first transaction can only happen if there is a min price before the current price.
- for each price, it could be a price of any of the 4 state : first transaction buy/sell price, and second transaction buy/sell price. 


```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    if (prices.empty()) return 0;
    int first_buy = INT_MAX, second_buy = INT_MAX;
    int first_profit = 0, second_profit = 0, max_profit = 0, n = prices.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){  
        second_profit = max(second_profit, prices[i]-second_buy);
        second_buy = min(second_buy, prices[i]-first_profit); // will be smallest when the first profit is largest
        first_profit = max(first_profit, prices[i]-first_buy); 
        first_buy = min(first_buy, prices[i]);
        max_profit = max(second_profit, first_profit);
    }
    return max_profit;
}
```
