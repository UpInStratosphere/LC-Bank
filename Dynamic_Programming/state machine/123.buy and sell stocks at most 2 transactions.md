State machine is used.
- a second transaction at the current price can only happen if the first transaction already occurred before.
- with each price, we are trying to maximize the profit at the end of each action (state)
    - 

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    if (prices.empty()) return 0;
    int first_buy = INT_MAX, second_buy = INT_MAX;
    int first_sell = 0, second_sell = 0, max_profit = 0, n = prices.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){  
        second_sell = max(second_sell, prices[i]-second_buy); //second buy needs to be as low as possible 
        second_buy = min(second_buy, prices[i]-first_sell); //first sell needs to be as high as possible
        first_sell = max(first_sell, prices[i]-first_buy);  //first buy needs to be as low as possible
        first_buy = min(first_buy, prices[i]); //first buy needs to be as low as possible
        max_profit = max(second_sell, first_sell);
    }
    return max_profit;
}
```
