- treat the problem as a graph problem:
    - each index is a node, and its neighbors are the indices the curr node can traverse to
    - the goal is to see if there is a path from the source node to the end node
        - source node : first index
        - end node: last index
    - O(N^2) at worst since graph traversal is O(V+E) and at worst E = V^2.


- For problems where each problem only needs 1 subproblem to be true to return true (essentially finding a path from root node to the leaf node), all the memo'ed answers are nodes that are false - because the entire function would've returned true IMMEDIATELY once a number is found to be true, no need to keep searching.


graph solution
```cpp
//graph solution
bool canJump(vector<int>&nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return true;
    unordered_map<int,bool>visited; //all cached nodes are false since we return true as soon as we find a path
    bool ans = check(0, nums.size()-1, nums, visited);
    return ans;
}

bool check(int curr, int target, const vector<int>&nums, unordered_map<int,bool>&visited){
    if (curr >= target) return true;

    if (visited.find(curr) != visited.end()) return visited[curr];

    //all the neighbor nodes of the curr node is formed by the max distance curr node can travel to
    int dest = nums[curr];
    for (int i = 1; i <= dest; ++i){
        int next = curr+i;
        if (check(next, target, nums, memo)){
            return true;
        }
    }
    memo[curr] = false;
    return false;
}
```

greedy solution: scan from back, see if first index is a starting index that can reach the last index
```cpp
bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return true;
    int start = nums.size()-1;
    for (int i = nums.size()-1; i >= 0; i--){
        if (i+nums[i] >= start) //if curr index can reach the prev start within its steps, then curr index can reach the last
            start = i;
    }
    return start == 0;
}
```
