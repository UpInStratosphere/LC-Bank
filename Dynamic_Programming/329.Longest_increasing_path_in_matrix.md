- For each cell, treat it as the starting node of the increasing path and call DFS.
    - we do DFS and NOT BACKTRACKING because regardless of whichever parent node (smaller node) leading to the current node (as the starting node of its increasing path). Once the increasing paths starting the current node are all visited with the first parent, they are not going to change as a result of different parent nodes (smaller nodes). Therefore, no need to change them.
    - use memo length table (instead of just a visited table) to remember each cell's longest increasing path with the cell as the starting node of an increasing path. This way, each cell will only have to be visited once with DFS and will record its answers when unwinding the stack.
 
 ```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIncreasingPath(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return 0;
        int res = 1, m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dirs = {{0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}};
        vector<vector<int>> memo(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int temp = dfs(matrix, memo, dirs, INT_MIN, i, j);
                res = max(res, temp);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    int dfs(const vector<vector<int>>&matrix, vector<vector<int>>&memo, const vector<vector<int>>&dirs, int prev, int x, int y) {
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || matrix[x][y] <= prev) return 0;
        if (memo[x][y] > 0) return memo[x][y];
        int mx = 1;
        for (auto a : dirs) {
            int x2 = x + a[0], y2 = y + a[1];
            int len = 1 + dfs(matrix, memo, dirs, matrix[x][y], x2, y2); //from the current neighbor node chosen
            mx = max(mx, len); //choose the longest path from all neighbors
        }
        memo[x][y] = mx;
        return mx;
    } 
};
