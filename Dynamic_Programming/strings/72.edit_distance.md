recursive relationship: memo[i][j] means the min steps to convert source[i,end] to target[j,end]
- memo[i][j] depends on knowing memo[i+1][j+1] because the entire strings need to be matched. 
- Once the postfix strings results are cached, they will not change regardless of the prefix substrings and just be used by bigger subproblem functions
    
If the problem is that entire strings need to be something, then memo[i] always depends on the memo[i+1]
- the prefix subproblem depends on the postfix subproblems
- for each recursive problem, we have the option of not only deleting the unmatched chars from either string OR change the unmatched chars to be the same and process the rest. 
    - deleting a char from the source string is equivalent of adding the unmatched char to the target and check the remaining.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.size(), n = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> memo(m, vector<int>(n,-1));
        return helper(word1, 0, word2, 0, memo);
    }
    
    //memo[i][j] means the min steps to convert source[i,end] to target[j,end]
    //competing subproblems: for curr mismatched position, choose max from 3 competing subproblems
    
    int helper(string&source, int i, string&target, int j, vector<vector<int>>& memo) { 
        //base case
        if (i == source.size()) 
            return target.size() - j;
        if (j == target.size()) 
            return source.size() - i;
        
        //memo case
        if (memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j];
        
        //recursive case
        int curr = 0;
        if (source[i] == target[j]) { //no need to edit curr chars, so the answer is the same as the postfix
            curr = helper(source, i + 1, target, j + 1, memo);
        } 
        else { 
            int insertCnt = helper(source, i, target, j + 1, memo);  //insert the missing char and check the next matching char
            int deleteCnt = helper(source, i + 1, target, j, memo);  //skip the curr and use the next char from source string
            int replaceCnt = helper(source, i + 1, target, j + 1, memo); //replace curr char and check next char 
            curr = min(insertCnt, min(deleteCnt, replaceCnt)) + 1;
        }
        memo[i][j] = curr;
        return curr;
    }
};
```
