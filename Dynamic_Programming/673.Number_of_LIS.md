- for each j that we check whenever we know that i can extend the LIS that can end at j
    - we only care about the LIS that ended at j that results higher LIS than the currently stored LIS for i OR
    - the LIS the ended at j that has the same length as the currently stored LIS for i (means we have different LIS that has the same max len that can end at current i)
    


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNumberOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int>freq(n,1);
        vector<int>len(n,1);
        int maxlen = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) { //capable to extend the LIS that ended at j
                    if (len[i] < len[j]+1){ //currently stored i's LIS is shorter than j's LIS extended with nums[i]. 
                       len[i] = len[j]+1;
                       freq[i] = freq[j];
                    }
                    else if (len[i] == len[j]+1) //currently stored i's LIS already matches j's LIS extended with nums[i]
                        freq[i] += freq[j];
                    
                    //if current i's LIS longer than j's LIS+1, then that j's LIS contribute nothing to i's LIS
                }
            }
            maxlen = max(maxlen, len[i]); //find the max LIS out of all the i's to get the global max LIS
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (len[i] == maxlen)
                ans += freq[i];
        }
        
        return ans;
