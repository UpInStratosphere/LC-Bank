- for each i that we check whenever nums[i] can extend the LIS that can ended before [i] , call it j.
    - if nums[i] can extend LIS ends at [j], then that means LIS at [i] will have the length of lis[j]+1
    - else if LIS[i] == LIS[j]+1, then both LIS (starting at i and j) need to be counted.
- LIS[i] intitialized to 1 because that the length of LIS that starts at nums[i] and ends at nums[i]
    - len[i]: the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence which ends with nums[i].
    - freq[i]: the number of the Longest Increasing Subsequence which ends with nums[i].
    
```cpp
int findNumberOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int>freq(n,1);
    vector<int>len(n,1);
    int maxlen = 0, max_cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) { 
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) { //capable to extend the LIS that ended at j
                if (len[i] < len[j]+1){ //currently stored i's LIS is shorter than j's LIS extended with nums[i]. 
                   len[i] = len[j]+1;
                   freq[i] = freq[j];
                }
                else if (len[i] == len[j]+1) //currently stored i's LIS already matches j's LIS extended with nums[i]
                    freq[i] += freq[j];
            }
        }
        if (maxlen < len[i]){
            maxlen = len[i];
            max_cnt = freq[i];
        }
        else if (maxlen == len[i])
            max_cnt += freq[i];
    }
