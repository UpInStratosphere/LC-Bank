- for each amount from 0 to target, total amount = the number of ways an amount can be formed with each coin denomination ALONE starting from .
    - base case is no coins used
    - fill up the entire value with each coin denomination
    - dp[i] = all ways of previous denomination + current denomination
    - only values that are larger than the current coin denomination can be affected by the coin

```cpp
int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
    if (amount == 0) return 1;
    if (coins.empty()) return 0;
    int n = coins.size();
    vector<int>dp(amount+1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        for (int j = 1; j <= amount; ++j){
            if (coins[i] <= j)
                dp[j] += dp[j-coins[i]];
        }
    }
    return dp[amount];
}
```
