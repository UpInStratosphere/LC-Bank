- brute force:
    - try out all the possible ways of f^d ways and count those that reached the target number
    - there are total of d levels, and for each level, we have 1 to f of braches to choose at each level 
- optimized: memo[dices remaining][target num remaining] = parameters to indicate the state of each subproblem
    - for each face value, there are d-1 remaining dices to choose from and to reach remaining target number
    - there are many ways to reach current remaining dices and current remaining target number given the order of the choices         create different ways (permutation instead of combination), so cache each DP state.
    - each subproblem state can be considered to be a node, each neighbor is the [d-1][remaining target - face value]
- optimized time: O(D * F * target) at most each subproblem needs to be solved once.
    - easier to calculate if treat the DP as a graph
        - there are D * target nodes, and each node is visited once
        - there are F edges for each node, and each edge is only visited once as well using DP



```cpp
int numRollsToTarget(int d, int f, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>>memo(d+1, vector<int>(target+1, -1));
        int MOD = 1000000000 + 7;
        return helper(d, f, target, memo, MOD);
    }

int helper(int d, int f, int target, vector<vector<int>>&memo, int MOD){
    //base case : early termination case (or valid case
    //termination case : min remaining roll value > target OR max remaining roll value < target
    if (d > target || d*f < target)
        return 0;
    if (d == 0 && target == 0)
        return 1;

    //memo case
    if (memo[d][target] != -1)
        return memo[d][target];
    
    //recursive case
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= f; i++){ //add up all combinations from each neighbor nodes (subproblems)
        res += helper(d-1, f, target-i, memo, MOD);
        res %= MOD;
    }
    memo[d][target] = res;
    return res;
}
```
