- different orders of traversal directions are different paths, hence this is a permutation problem, as most of these dinstinct path problems are.
- for each cell, count how many ways are there from the start to reach this cell (adding top and left cell's counts)
    - dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
- in the end, return ways [m-1][n-1]

```cpp
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>>paths(m, vector<int>(n,1)); //both the first row and col's cells have 1 way
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++){
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++){
            paths[i][j] = paths[i][j-1] + paths[i-1][j];
        }
    }
    return paths[m-1][n-1];
}
```
