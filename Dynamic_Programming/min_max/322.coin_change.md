generate optimal solutions for *all values* in the target and return the value for the target
- for each value from 1 to target, use it as an endpoint that we need to find the shortest path
- shortest path: the least number of coins that we selected to make the current value
- dp[i] = min(dp[i-k]+1 where k is each coin denomination value)

```cpp
int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
    int mx = amount+1;
    vector<int>dp(amount+1,mx); 
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < coins.size(); j++){ 
            if (coins[j] <= i){
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-coins[j]]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    if (dp[amount] == mx) return -1; //meaning curr amount is unbreakable with given denominations
    return dp[amount];
}
```
