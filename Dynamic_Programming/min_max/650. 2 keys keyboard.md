for any amount, the default action would be copy and paste 1 char, so the worst case for each amount would be i itself.
- to optimize, we find the largest number of characters in a sequence that we can copy and paste and get the curr i amount.

```cpp
int minSteps(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 0; 
    vector<int>dp(n+1, 0); 
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++){
        dp[i] = i; 
        for (int j = i - 1; j > 1; j--){ //find the largest sequence able to be pasted
            if (i % j == 0){
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i / j)); 
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```
