The original problem, given all the house as options, to the last house, what sequence of choices will have the max result
- subproblems for curr problem are different depending on whether the curr house is picked or not
    - if curr house is picked, then we need to use the max result from 2 houses ago + curr house
    - if curr is not picked, then curr result is the same as the last house
- without DP, the problem is basically a backtracking problem
    - because it is a backtracking problem, different nodes may connect to the same lower level nodes, hence we should calculate the lower nodes and cache them so they don't have to be re-calculated each time.
        - this is similar to postorder traversal where we need to get the answers for the subtrees first.
    
```cpp
int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int>memo(n, -1);
    return helper(nums, n-1, memo);
}

int helper(const vector<int>&nums, int index, vector<int>&memo){
    //base case
    if (index < 0) return 0;
    if (index == 0) return nums[0];

    //memo case
    if (memo[index] != -1) return memo[index];

    //recursive case
    int curr = max(helper(nums,index-1,memo), helper(nums,index-2,memo)+nums[index]);
    memo[index] = curr;
    return curr;
}
```
