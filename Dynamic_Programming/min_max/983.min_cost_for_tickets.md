- for each day travelled, the min cost is either the total prev cost + buy a new daily ticket or use a weekly/monthly ticket that was purchased before and can cover current day.
- dp[i] = the min ticket cost that ends on current day
    - dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] = cost[0], dp[i-7] + costs[1], dp[i-30]+costs[2])

```cpp
int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
    unordered_set<int>travel(days.begin(), days.end());
    int dp[366] = {0}; //first value is set 0, and the rest is set to 0 by default 
    for (int i = 1; i <= days.back(); ++i){ //assume the travelled days are sorted 
        if (travel.find(i) == travel.end())
            dp[i] == dp[i-1];
        else{
            int alt1 = dp[i-1]+ costs[0];
            int alt2 = dp[max(0,i-7)] + costs[1]; 
            int alt2 = dp[max(0, i-30)] + costs[2];
            dp[i] = min(alt1, min(alt2, alt3));
        }
    }
    return dp[days.back()];
}
```
