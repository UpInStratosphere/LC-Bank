- How to represent the main problem with initial parameters
    - this determines the subproblems' parameters 
- At the function for the current problem, how does the current problem relate to the smaller subproblems
    - usually for the intermediate problem / curr function, there are multi-branched recursion on subproblems. Different combination of the upper functions (upper level nodes conenctions) will arrive at the duplicate subproblems (lower level nodes in a DAG).
    - How to "combine" the answers from subproblems to find the answer for the current level
- What are the NECESSARY base cases
