- How to represent the main problem with initial parameters
    - this determines the subproblems' parameters 
- At the current problem, how to break current problem into smaller subproblems
    - Different combination of the upper functions (upper level nodes connections) will result duplicate subproblems (lower level nodes in a DAG).
    - usually there are multi-branched recursion for each function. 
    - How to "combine" the answers from subproblems.
- What are the NECESSARY base cases
