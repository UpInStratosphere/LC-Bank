find the start of the array (not just the smallest value) < current last element 
- the only problem is when [mid] == base, this means the smallest may be in the left or the right of the mid (depending on how the array is rotated)
    - shrink the left and right boundary this iteration and do not drop any part (not sure which part to drop)
- whenever the pivot is unchanged from last index, then that means the last element value is the smallest, hence the smallest element of the original data must be the first element of the same value, so scan forward and find the first element

- because of the worst time of n/2 decreasing boundaries inside of the while loop (and the last step to find the smallest element, not just just the smallest value), then total time is O(N)

```cpp
int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return -1;
    int n = nums.size();
  
    int left = 0, right = n-1, pivot = n-1, target = nums[right];
    while (left <= right){
        int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
        if (nums[mid] == target){
            if (nums[left] == nums[mid]) 
                left++;
            if (nums[right] == nums[mid])
                right--;
        }
        else if (nums[mid] < target){
            pivot = mid;
            right = mid-1;
        }
        else
            left = mid+1;
    }
    //this part is only needed whenever we need the first element, not for finding the smallest value
    if (pivot == n-1){
        while(pivot > 0 && nums[pivot] == nums[pivot-1]){
            pivot--;
        }
    }
    return nums[pivot];
}
```
