Finding the square root of positive number
- the value must be between 1 and X itself, so use binary search since this search space is naturally sorted.
- find the target number whose squared == X OR the last number whose squared < X given any decimal would be truncated

```cpp
int mySqrt(int x) {
    if (x == 0) return 0;
    int res = 1;
    int left = 1, right = x;
    while(left <= right){
        int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
        if (mid == x/mid)
            return mid;
        else if (mid < x/mid){ //keep the current mid as the best candidate so far
            res = mid;
            left = mid+1;
        }
        else
            right = mid-1;
    }
    return res;
}
```
