- use classic binary search to find the first one, then last one.

```cpp

//initialize first to -1 to indicate that it is not found yet
int first = -1, left = 0, right = nums.size()-1;
while(left <= right){
    int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
    if (nums[mid] == target){
        first = mid;
        right = mid-1;
    }
    else if (nums[mid] < target) 
        left = mid+1;
    else
        right = mid-1;
}
if (first == -1) return {-1,-1}; //when no instance of the target is found
int last = -1;
left = first, right = nums.size()-1;
while(left <= right){
    int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
    if (nums[mid] == target){
        second = mid;
        last = mid+1;
    }
    else if (nums[mid] < target) 
        left = mid+1;
    else
        right = mid-1;
}
return {first, last}; //this is the range of the first and last instances of the target, they may be the same
```
