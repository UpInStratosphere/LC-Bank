- use binary search to find an element that has the smallest difference, then expand from that number until K numbers are found
    - use a variable to track the current smallest difference element.
    - if target value is not in data, then at the end 2 remaining elements, one smaller and one larger will both be examined and 
- when trying to decide whether an element will be included, make sure its index is within bound

```cpp
 vector<int> findClosestElements(vector<int>& arr, int k, int x) {
    if (arr.empty()) return {};
    int n = arr.size();
    if (k > n) return {};
    int index = -1, left = 0, right = n-1, diff = INT_MAX;
    vector<int>res;
    
    //find an element that has min diff 
    while(left <= right){
        int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
        if (abs(arr[mid] - x) < diff){
            index = mid;
            diff = abs(arr[mid] - x);
        }
        if (arr[mid] == x)
            break;
        else if (arr[mid] > x)
            right = mid-1;
        else 
            left = mid + 1;

    }
    //index will be the element with the smallest difference
    k -= 1;
    int start = index-1, end = index+1;
    while (k > 0){
        if (start < 0)
            end++;
        else if (end == n)
            start--;
        else if ((abs(arr[start]-x) <= abs(arr[end]-x)))
            start--;
        else
            end++;
        k-=1;      
    }

    for (int i = start+1; i <= end-1; i++)
        res.push_back(arr[i]);
    return res;
    
}
```
