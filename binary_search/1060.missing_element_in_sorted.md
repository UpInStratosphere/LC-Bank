Brute force O(N)
    - linear search with a missing tracker and tracker for next variable
Binary search O(logN)
- find the first index with >= Kth missing. 
    - Must be the first because consecutive numbers can have the same number of missings, but only the first one will have a gap with the previous number. The missing number is in the range of numbers in the gap. 
    - example: [3,7,8,9,10] k = 3
- binary search only applies to **sorted numbers** for which the target number is **within the range** of the numbers.

```cpp
//function used to count the total missing number of elements from the first num until curr index
int missing(int curr, const vector<int>& nums){
    return nums[curr] - nums[0] - curr;
}

int missingElement(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (nums.empty()) return -1;
    if (k == 0) return nums[0];
    int n = nums.size();
    if (missing(n-1,nums) < k) return nums[n-1] + (k-missing(n-1, nums));
    
    int index = -1, left = 0, right = n-1, res = 0;
    while(left <= right){
        int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
        if (missing(mid, nums) >= k){
            index = mid;
            right = mid-1;
        }
        else
            left = mid+1;
    }
    
    //returns the the correct answer regardless of the index found is > or == to Kth missing
    return nums[index-1] + (k-missing(index-1, nums));
}
```
