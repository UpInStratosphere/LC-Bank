- Because we don't know the relative values of the elements (there might be a number of sharp up/down turns with flat up/downs), we can't just find first/last element of . But we can use nums[mid] and nums[mid-1] to find the peak of the subarray that contains last picked nums[mid] in the while loop.

- this only works if all numbers are unique, no duplicates.
```cpp
int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return -1;
    int index = 0, left = 0, right = nums.size()-1;
   
    while(left <= right){
        int mid = left + (right-left);
        if (mid == 0 || nums[mid] > nums[mid-1]){
            index = mid;
            left = mid+1;
        }
        else 
            right = mid-1;
    }
    return index;
}
```

- if the entire array is decreasing, eventually mid will hit index 0, and index will be assigned to 0.
