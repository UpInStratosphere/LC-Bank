- both source and target first need to be the same length
- treat source as the buckets that contains all the characters that we can use to construct the target word
- if they are anagram, then each char's buckets should contain enough copies to make the target word
    - if at point, the char currently needed in the target is not found, or has a <= 0 freq (already all used up), this char needs to be included in the source (it will needs to replace the extra chars that are not used from the source)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        if (s.empty() || t.empty()) return 0;
        if (s.size() != t.size()) return -1; //to indicate they are not going be anagrams since they are different length
        int n = s.size();
        int res = 0;
        unordered_map<char,int>freq;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            freq[s[i]]++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if (freq.find(t[i]) == freq.end() || freq[t[i]] <= 0)
                res++;
            freq[t[i]]--;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
