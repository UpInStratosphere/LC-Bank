- string must satisfy the condition:
    - at any point, the number of current closed brackets must not exceed the current open brackets. As long as this holds true, we can keep adding closed brackets.
- generate the total valid strings with N open brackets at front, then N-1 open brackets at front, then N-2...
    - fill up the start with open brackets as much as possible, then start turning the open brackets, from inside out, to closed brackets 
    - this can be achieved by start filling the string with closed brackets after filling the open brackets as long as the current total closed < open brackets. 
- total time complexity: B^D. 
    - B is the number of braches (subproblems) at each level - each char can either be open or closed
    - D is the max depth of the path - each path (valid string) must be 2N length
    - so total is 2^(2N)
    
```cpp
void build(int left, int right, int target, string &curr, vector<string>&res){
    if (curr.size() == target * 2){
        res.push_back(curr);
        return;
    }
    //fill up the open brackets as much as possible 
    if (left < target){
        curr.push_back('(');
        build(left+1, right, target, curr, res);
        curr.pop_back();
    }
    //then can start filling up closed brackets as long as the closed brackets <= total open brackets so far
    if (right < left){
        curr.push_back(')');
        build(left, right+1, target, curr, res);
        curr.pop_back();
    }
}
```
