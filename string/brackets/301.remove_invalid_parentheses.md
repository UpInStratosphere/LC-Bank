- Here, we need ALL of the longest valid parentheses (remove min)

- for BFS, queue store unique elements that are visited for the first time (regardless of which path)
    - all nodes in the same level are X steps away from the source (same path length)
    - the same level refers to the nodes that are in the queue in the beginning of each iteration (queue will add additional nodes that further away from the source node while we process the nodes in the current level)
    - same nodes may be visited again by below
        - a different path of the same distance (the same node is already stored in the current level)
        - a different path of a longer distance (the same node was stored in the previous upper level)
    - whether or not the same node should be pushed into the queue depends on
        - if we want to know all the end nodes of the shortest length, repeated node should not be counted
        - if we want to know all the shortest paths, then we can push in the same node that were visited in the current level, but not those that were visited in higher levels.
        
- Here, we want all the shortest balanced strings (min chars deleted from the original string), thus, we don't re-count nodes that are already visited in the upper levels or the current level

        q.push(s); 
        visited.insert(s);
        bool found = false;  //flag to mark when the shortest balanced string is found 
        
        while(!q.empty()){
            int len = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){
                string curr = q.front(); 
                q.pop();
                //if the curr string is balanced, then we do not further remove chars and only process the remaining strings in the current level after the first found
                if (check(curr)){
                    res.push_back(curr);
                    found = true;
                }
                //if curr is not yet found, keep deleting chars from the current popped string
                if (!found){
                    for(int j = 0; j < curr.size(); j++){
                        if (curr[j] != '(' && curr[j] != ')') continue;
                        string temp = curr.substr(0,j) + curr.substr(j+1);
                        if (visited.find(temp) == visited.end()){
                            visited.insert(temp);

                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            if (found) break; //if a balanced string is found after we process all nodes in the curr level, don't keep checking the strings in the next level 
        }
        return res;
}

bool check(const string &s){
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
        if (s[i] == '(') count++;
        else if (s[i] == ')'){
            if (count == 0) return false;
            count--;
        }
    }
