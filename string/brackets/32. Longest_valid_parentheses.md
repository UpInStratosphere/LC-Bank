- The number of any valid substring will have to satisfy the valid parentheses condition:
    - the total closed bracket at any index cannot exceed the total open brackets we have so far in the string
    
- break the string into disjoint valid windows separated by extra brackets
    - scan forward once and at each index where we have an extra closed bracket, we reset the current active substring and start a new one until the next balanced substring is found.
    - scan backward and at each index where we have an extra open bracket, terminate the current active substring and start a new one until the next balanced substring is found.

- this satisfies the max of each local (each local balanced substring will be compared) will be the global max paradigm.

```cpp
int longestValidParentheses(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    int res = 0, left = 0, right = 0, len = s.size();
    //scan forward and keep track of current balanced window
    //start a new window if at any index the total closed > total open because no substring from start containing this curr closed can be a balanced string
    
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){
        if (s[i] == '(')
            left++;
        else
            right++;
        
        //if window is valid, update. If window is invalid, reset. keep going if the window can be potentially balanced.
        if (left == right)
            res = max(res, left+right);
        else if (left < right){ 
            left = 0; 
            right = 0;
        }
    }
    
    //scan backward and keep track of balanced windows and reset each index where the total open > total closed.
    left = 0; right = 0;
    for (int j = len-1; j >= 0; j--){
        if (s[j] == '(')
            left++;
        else
            right++;
        if (left == right)
            res = max(res, left+right);
        else if (left > right){
            left = 0; 
            right = 0;
        }    
    }
    return res;
}
```
