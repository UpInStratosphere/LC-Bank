- The number of any valid substring will have to satisfy the valid parentheses condition:
    - the total closed bracket at any index cannot exceed the total open brackets we have so far in the string
    
- break the string into disjoint valid windows separated by extra brackets
    - scan forward once and at each index where we have an extra closed bracket, we reset the current active substring and start a new one until the next balanced substring is found.
    - scan backward and at each index where we have an extra open bracket, terminate the current active substring and start a new one until the next balanced substring is found.

- scan forward, only tracks the unbalanced substring caused by extra closed brackets. 
    - Any balanced substring inside the current unbalanced substring caused by extra open brackets will not be counted (because algorithm says keep going). 
- scan backwards and check unbalanced substrings caused by extra open brackets as well. 

```cpp
int longestValidParentheses(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    int res = 0, left = 0, right = 0, len = s.size();
    //if window is valid, update global. 
    //if window is invalid, reset both counters. 
    //if currently unknown, do nothing and keep going.
    
    
    //
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){
        if (s[i] == '(')
            left++;
        else
            right++;
 
        if (left == right)
            res = max(res, left+right);
        else if (left < right){ 
            left = 0; 
            right = 0;
        }
    }
    
    left = 0; right = 0;
    for (int j = len-1; j >= 0; j--){
        if (s[j] == '(')
            left++;
        else
            right++;
        if (left == right)
            res = max(res, left+right);
        else if (left > right){
            left = 0; 
            right = 0;
        }    
    }
    return res;
}
