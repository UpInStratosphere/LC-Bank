- we need to actually know which one to remove, not the min number to remove
- to make the parentheses balanced, we either remove the extra parentheses. OR add the opposite parentheses to balance extras.

How parentheses are matched
- each closed can only use open brackets BEFORE
    - each closed bracket is used to match the closest open bracket as soon as it is met, resulting in 
        - extra closed brackets is always the later ones in **extra closed brackets group**
        - extra open brackers are always the **earlier open brackets in the entire data*
    
```cpp
 string minRemoveToMakeValid(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return "";
    int n = s.size();
    stack<int>open;
    unordered_set<int>extra;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if (s[i] == '('){
            open.push(i);
        }
        else{
            if (open.empty())
                extra.insert(i);
            else
                open.pop();
        }
    }
    while(!open.empty()){
        extra.insert(open.top());
        open.pop();
    }
    
    string res = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if (extra.find(i) == extra.end()){
            res += s[i];
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
- follow up: how to produce the min cost of removal
    - use two max heaps to store open and closed by their costs
    - closed heap stores all the closed brackets that can use the current stored open
    - open heap stores all the open brackets from the beginning 
```cpp
int removeMin2(string s, vector<int>cost){ // NlogN due to heap insertion/pop cost is logN
    int res = 0;
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, lesser<int>>open; //max heaps
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, lesser<int>>closed; //store the same closed bracket group
    int i = 0, len = s.size();
    while (i < len) {
        if (s[i] == '('){
            open.push(cost[i]);
            i++;
        }
        else if (s[i] == ')'){
            //heap stores the same closed bracket group - meaning each one can use the current open brackets stored
            while(i < len && s[i] == ')'){
                closed.push(cost[i]);
                i++;
            }
            //match biggest cost closed brackets with the biggest cost previous open brackets
            while(!open.empty() && !close.empty()){
                closed.pop(); 
                open.pop();
            }
            //remove any remaining closed brackets since no more prev open brackets to use and cannot use later open brackets
            while(!closed.empty()){
                res += closed.top();
                closed.pop();
            }
        }
        else //if the element is an alphabet. This may not be needed
            i++;
    }
    //remaing open brackets are those extra with smallest cost that need to be removed
    if (!open.empty()){
        res += open.top();
        open.pop();
    }
    return res;      
}
```
