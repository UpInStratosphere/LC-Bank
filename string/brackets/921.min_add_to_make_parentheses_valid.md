A string of parentheses is valid if 
    - its total balance is 0 (open bracket is +1, close bracket is -1)
    - every prefix substring has a non-negative balance (every point the total left >= total right)
   
To make the string balanced - add all missing open brackets at the front, and add all missing close brackets at the end. 
   - each closed bracket will balance out the closest open bracket in front (LIFO)
   - the missing open brackets can be added to the front for the extra closed brackets
   - the missing closed brackets can be added to the back for the extra open brackets

- if at any point the bracket balance is negative, it means we have an extra closed bracket and we need to add an open bracket at the front (because all the original open brackets are used up)
- if the net balance is positive, then we need to add closed bracket at the end.

```cpp
int minAddToMakeValid(string S) {
    if (S.empty()) return 0;
    int open = 0, closed = 0;
    int n = S.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if (S[i] == '('){
            open++;
        }
        else{
            if (open > 0)
                open--;
            else
                closed++;
        }   
    }
    return open + closed;
}
```
