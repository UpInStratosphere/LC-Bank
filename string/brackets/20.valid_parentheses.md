- a valid parentheses must conform the below condition (if there is only one type)
    - each current closed bracket have an open bracket before to be matched with (open cannot be 0 when curr bracket is closed)
    - in the end, there should not be additional unmatched open brackets

- here, cannot track open bracket number because there are different types 
    - each current closed bracket must match the type of the prev open bracket.
- but still check if there are any leftover open bracket
    
```cpp
bool isValid(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return true;
    unordered_map<char,char>open{{'[',']'}, {'{','}'}, {'(',')'}};
    int n = s.size();
    stack<char>stk;
    for (char c : s){
        if (open.find(c) != open.end()) 
            stk.push(c);
        else{
            if (stk.empty()) //no open brackets to match 
                return false;
            if (open[stk.top()] != c) //wrong open bracket type
                return false;
            stk.pop();
        }
    }
    if (!stk.empty()) return false;
    return true;
}
```
