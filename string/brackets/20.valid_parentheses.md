- a valid parentheses must conform the below condition (if there is only one type)
    - each closed bracket must match with the closest open bracket from the front
    - at any point, the number of closed should not exceed the number of open brackets that can be matched
    - in the end, there should not be additional unmatched open brackets

- here, we don't care about the total number of brackets, we only care if each close bracket can match with the closest open bracket of the same type
    
```cpp
bool isValid(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return true;
    unordered_map<char,char>match{{'[',']'}, {'{','}'}, {'(',')'}};
    int n = s.size();
    stack<char>open;
    for (char c : s){
        if (match.find(c) != match.end()) 
            open.push(c);
        else{
            if (open.empty()) //no matching 
                return false;
            if (match[open.top()] != c) //wrong matching type
                return false;
            open.pop();
        }
    }
    if (!open.empty()) return false;
    return true;
}
```
