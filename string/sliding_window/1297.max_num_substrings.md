- greedy approach:
    - if curr minsized substring works, then any longer substring that contains this substring will either
        - have more unique chars than the condition (this min substring may work, but max substring does not) or 
        - add the same chars as the min substring (both min and max substrings work)
    - max substring that contains the working substring will never appear more than the substring 
    - check each continuous minsized substring and find the max freq out of them
- but this only works for getting the max freq substrings, does not determine which substrings are all possibly valid.

```cpp
int maxFreq(string s, int maxLetters, int minSize, int maxSize) {
    int start=0, result=0;
    unordered_map<int,int> count;           	
    unordered_map<string,int> occurence;    
    for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
        count[s[i]]++;						
        if(i-start+1>minSize){
            count[s[start]]--;
            if(count[s[start]] == 0)			
                count.erase(s[start]);
            start++;
        }
        if(i-start+1==minSize && count.size() <= maxLetters)	
           int curr = occurence[s.substr(start,i-start+1)]; 
           res = max(res, curr);
    }
    return result;
}
```
