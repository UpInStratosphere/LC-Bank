- use a hashmap to keep track of the chars in the current window
- curr window must include the curr char
    - if the curr window has a repeating char, then delete all chars in the window including the first instance of the curr char 
- Look at the diagram drawn.
    - the reason why this works is because it checks for the longest window as we scan forward, then shrink the window to see if there are any longer substring within in the current window when we shrink the start.

```cpp
int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
    //total of n^2 substrings
    //if check each substrings, then that's n^3 time.
    //bottle neck is not re-using some of the answers 
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    unordered_map<char,int>window;
    int start = 0, n = s.size(), res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        window[s[i]]++;
        while(window[s[i]] > 1){
            window[s[start]]--;
            start++;
        }
        res = max(res, i-start+1);
    }
    return res;
}


int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    unordered_set<char>window;
    int start = 0, n = s.size(), res = 0;
    for (char c : s){
        if (window.find(c) != window.end()){
            while(s[start] != c){
                window.erase(s[start]);
                start++;
            }
            window.erase(c);
            start++;
        }
        window.insert(c);
        res = max(res, (int)window.size());
    }
    return res;
}
```
