- use a hashmap to keep track of the chars in the current window
- each of the curr window must include the curr char
    - if the curr window has a repeating char, then delete all chars in the window until the first instance of the char from the curr window
- this works because if any prev char before the curr char has a repeating instance before, then for the current window to include the prev char, we must not include any substring that include the first instance. Hence, shrunken part of the current window will never be included the later windows.

```cpp
int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
    //if the window is invalid after adding the curr char, then curr is a duplicate 
    //Remove the first instance of the curr char to get the longest ending at curr
    //each possible end is matched with the min start for that end
        if (s.empty()) return 0;
    unordered_map<char,int>window;
    int start = 0, n = s.size(), res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        window[s[i]]++;
        while(window[s[i]] > 1){
            window[s[start]]--;
            start++;
        }
        res = max(res, i-start+1);
    }
    return res;
}
```
