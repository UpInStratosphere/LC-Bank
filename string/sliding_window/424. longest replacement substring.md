To get the longest substring with the replacement, as long as the window length - most frequent in the window <= k, then the current window is valid (changing the least that needs to be changed to achieve the same char for the curr window)
- a longer substring could only result when the most freq is more (because the longest for the existing most freq is already reached), so we only shift the window start by 1 and hoping that the next char will be a most frequent char.
    - **global longest will only increase when any increase in curr window length is caused by a increase in most freq amount, so the best practice is exclude the start char and include the new char 1 by 1**.
        - the window start is a NON most freq char, if the new char is the new most freq (window length stayed the same with increase in most freq, global longest is the same)
        - the window start is a most freq char, the number of replacement is still the same as before shifting and the curr window is still invalid, so keep shifting the window until the increase in window's length is driven by the increase in most freq char and reaching a longer substring
        

```cpp
 int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    int n = s.size(), start = 0;
    int max_count = 0;
    int res = 0;
    unordered_map<char,int>freq;
    for (int end = 0; end < n; end++){
        char c = s[end];
        freq[c]++;
        max_count = max(max_count, freq[c]); 
        int replace_count = end-start+1-max_count; 
        if (replace_count > k){ 
            freq[s[start]]--;
            start++;
        }
        else
            res = max(res, end-start+1); 
    }
    return res;
}
```
