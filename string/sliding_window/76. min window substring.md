Find each valid end for a window
- then find the shortest start for each valid end to form the current min window
- the next valid window will start AFTER the start of the current window

```cpp
string minWindow(string s, string t) {
    if (s.empty() || t.empty()) return "";
    unordered_map<char,int>window;
    for (char c : t)
        window[c]++;
    //counter is number of unique characters from that have not yet to be included in the current window
    //only the characters that are in the target string will be tracked
    int counter = window.size(), n = s.size(), start = 0, min_len = INT_MAX, min_start = -1;
    for (int end = 0; end < n; ++end){
        window[s[end]]--;
        if (window[s[end]] == 0) 
            counter--;
        //this only triggers whenever the current window encompasses all of the target subtring's characters
        while (counter == 0){
            int curr_len = end-start+1;
            if (curr_len < min_len){
                min_len = curr_len;
                min_start = start;
            }
            //when removing the curr window's start, we add the freq back to indicate unique chars need to be find 
            window[s[start]]++;
            if (window[s[start]] == 1)
                counter++;
            start++;
        }
    }

    if (min_start == -1) return "";
    return s.substr(min_start, min_len);
}
```
