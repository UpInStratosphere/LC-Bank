Similar to min window substring, Sliding window can be used here because 
- Given all positive integers, the result for the sliding window will be monotonic 
- the condition for the window is binary: 
    - expand when the curr window doesn't meet the requirement
    - for the valid end, find the shortest subarray that works with it by shrinking the window
    - each valid window end can re-use the previous work as much as possible 


```cpp
int minSubArrayLen(int s, vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty() || s < 0) return 0;
    int start = 0, n = nums.size(), res = n+1, curr = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        curr += nums[i];
        while(curr >= s){ 
            res = min(res, i-start+1);
            curr-=nums[start];
            start++;
        }
    }
    if (res == n+1) return 0;
    return res;
}
```
