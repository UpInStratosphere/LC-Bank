One time sliding window doesn't work because we don't know when to shrink or expand the window given there are 2 conditions
- do we shrink or expand when unique chars < K chars in the current window?
    - we could shrink to eliminate the K chars until it matches unique chars
    - OR we could expand until K chars matches the unique chars
- solution is to only use one condition to expand and shrink (the window condition must be be binary when checked)
    - for there are only 26 chars, so the unique chars for each window can be from 1 to 26. 
    - Find the longest substring that is H unique and each appeared >= k times.
    

```cpp
int longestSubstring(string s, int k) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    int maxLen = 0, n = s.size();

    //find the longest substring for each unique char window: 1 to 26
    for (int curr = 1; curr<=26; curr++){
        int start = 0, freq = 0, curr_max = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int>entry;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            //expand as long as the unique char is <= the curr freq
            entry[s[i]]++;
            if(entry[s[i]] == k)
                freq++;

            while(entry.size() > curr){
                entry[s[start]]--;
                if (entry[s[start]] == k-1) 
                    freq--;
                if(entry[s[start]] == 0)
                    entry.erase(s[start]);
                start++;
            }

            if (entry.size() == curr && freq == curr)
                curr_max = max(curr_max, i-start+1);
        }
        maxLen = max(maxLen, curr_max);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```
