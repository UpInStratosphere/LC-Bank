One time sliding window doesn't work because we don't know when to shrink or expand the window given there are 2 conditions
- do we shrink or expand when unique chars < K chars in the current window?
    - we could shrink to eliminate the K chars until it matches unique chars
    - OR we could expand until K chars matches the unique chars
- solution is to only use one condition to expand and shrink (the window condition must be be binary when checked)
    - for there are only 26 chars, so the unique chars for each window can be from 1 to 26. 
    - Find the longest substring that has **AT MOST** H unique (this rule is used to expand/shrink the window)
        - check for whether curr window has exactly H unique and each char appeared >= k times for each valid window. 
        - Because of the way to expand/shrink the window, the curr window will def visit the longest valid window that satisfies the constraint (each valid substring is visited BEFORE getting to the longest substring)

  
```cpp
int longestSubstring(string s, int k) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    int maxLen = 0, n = s.size();

    //find the longest substring for each total unique char counts window: 1 to 26
    for (int total = 1; total <= 26; total++){
        int start = 0, counter = 0, curr_max = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int>unique;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            unique[s[i]]++;
            if(unique[s[i]] == k)
                counter++;

            while(unique.size() > curr){
                unique[s[start]]--;
                if (unique[s[start]] == k-1) 
                    counter--;
                if(unique[s[start]] == 0)
                    unique.erase(s[start]);
                start++;
            }

            if (unique.size() == total && counter == total)
                curr_max = max(curr_max, i-start+1);
        }
        maxLen = max(maxLen, curr_max);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```
