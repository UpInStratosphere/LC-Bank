Typical sliding window does not work because if we need exactly K, do we expand or shrink after the curr window has exactly K numbers (including the next element in the window may or may not invalidate the current window), hence no definitive condition to expand or shrink the window.

Cannot use prefix sum method either, because that only works for questions where the prefix result and the postfix result are independent of each other.
    - There might be overlap of unique characters between the prefix and the suffix. If we only track the the non-overlap unique characters of prefix and postfix that makes up exactly K unique, we may overlook some valid subarrays when the suffix have some of the same characters as the prefix.

Each end would increase the total valid substrings by number of elements in the curr window
- for the new element added is counted as end, and all elements included in window is coutned as start.

```cpp
int subarraysWithKDistinct(vector<int>& A, int K) {
    if (A.empty() || K == 0) return 0;
    return helper(A, K) - helper(A, K-1);
}

int helper(vector<int>&A, int K){
    int n = A.size();
    int start = 0, res = 0;
    unordered_map<int,int>freq;
    for (int end = 0; end < n; end++){
        int num = A[end];
        freq[num]++;
        while (freq.size() > K){
            int temp = A[start];
            freq[temp]--;
            if (freq[temp] == 0) freq.erase(temp);
            start++;
        }
        res += end-start+1; 
    }
    return res;
}
```
