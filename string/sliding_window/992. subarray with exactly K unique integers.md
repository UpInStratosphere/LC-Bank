Typical sliding window does not work because if we need exactly K, do we expand or shrink after the curr window has exactly K numbers (including the next element in the window may or may not invalidate the current window), hence no definitive condition to expand or shrink the window.

Cannot use prefix sum method either, because that only works for questions where the prefix data and the suffix data are independent of each other.
    - There might be overlap of unique characters between the prefix and the suffix. If we only track the the non-overlap unique charactesr of prefix and suffix that makes up exactly K unique, we may overlook some valid subarrays when the suffix have some of the same characters as the prefix.

Transform the question into at most K and at most K-1. So after we find all the valid subarrays of each, we can just substract them since the number of subarrays <= K unique will contain subarrays < K, the remaining will be exactly K.

```cpp
int subarraysWithKDistinct(vector<int>& A, int K) {
    if (A.empty() || K == 0) return 0;
    return helper(A, K) - helper(A, K-1);
}

int helper(vector<int>&A, int K){
    int n = A.size();
    int start = 0, res = 0;
    unordered_map<int,int>freq;
    for (int end = 0; end < n; end++){
        int num = A[end];
        freq[num]++;
        while (freq.size() > K){
            int temp = A[start];
            freq[temp]--;
            if (freq[temp] == 0)
                freq.erase(temp);
            start++;
        }

        res += end-start; //all the nums from start to end-1 can act as the start for the end for the current window
    }
    return res;
}
```
