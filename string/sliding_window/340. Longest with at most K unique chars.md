For each char, treat it as the end of a valid window. The longest must have one of the chars as the end, which means as long as we find the longest of all the ends, we will have the longest window.
- if curr window size exceed target AFTER 


```cpp
int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s, int k) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    int start = 0, longest = 0, n = s.size();
    unordered_map<char,int>window; //used to optimize O(N) to check current window to O(1)
    for (int end = 0; end < n; ++end){ 
        window[s[end]]++;
        while (window.size() > k){ //curr added is a unique, must remove one unique char from the curr window
            freq[s[start]]--;
            if (freq[s[start]] == 0)
                freq.erase(s[start]);
            start++;
        }
        longest = max(longest, end-start+1);  
    }
    return longest;
}
```
