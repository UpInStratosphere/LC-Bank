Use a flag to determine which row the next char should be added to
- the rows are added in an oscillating manner

```cpp
string convert(string s, int numRows) {

    if (numRows == 1) return s;
    string res = "";

    //in case that the string is not long enough to fill a single char for each row
    vector<string>rows(min(numRows, int(s.size())));

    int curRow = 0;
    int direction = 0; //initialize to 0 since start at row 0 at first regardless

    for (char c : s) {
        rows[curRow] += c;

        if (curRow == 0)
            direction = -1;
        else if (curRow == rows.size()-1)
            direction = 1;

        if (direction == -1) 
            curRow += 1;
        else
            curRow -= 1;
    
    }

    for (string row : rows) 
        res += row;
    return res;
}
```
