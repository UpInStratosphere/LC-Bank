- source and string must be the same size to be an anagram
- treat the source as the bucket that contains all the characters that can be used to construct the target word
- the count for each char must be 0 after looping through all chars in each both words
    - if the target has a char that source doesn't have or have extra copies than the source, the count for that char would be negative
    - if the count for a char is positive (did not get used) at the end, then that means there are other missing characters elsewhere since the total count of the two words are the same 
    
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        if (s.size() != t.size()) return false;
        
        unordered_map<char,int>freq;
        for (char c : s)
            freq[c]++;
        
        for (char c: t){
            //if we encounter a new letter OR already exhausted all copies of the char from the source
            if (freq.find(c) == freq.end() || freq[c] == 0)
                return false;
            freq[c]--;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
