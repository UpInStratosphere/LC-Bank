- for BFS, queue store unique elements that are visited for the first time (regardless of which path)
    - all nodes in the same level are X steps away from the source (same path length)
    - the same level refers to the nodes that are in the queue in the beginning of each iteration (queue will add additional nodes that further away from the source node while we process the nodes in the current level)
    - same node may be visited again by curr path for which the curr path is
        - a different path of the same distance (the node was visited the first time in the current level)
        - a different path of a longer distance (the node was visited the first time in a previous upper level)
    - whether or not the same node can be revisited depends on
        - if we want to know all the paths that lead to the target(s), then we can revisit a node that's visited the first time in the current level (but not those that were visited the first time on a higher level) since there may be more than 1 shortest path that lead to the same target.
        - if we just want the target(s), no node can be re-visited again.
        
- We need ALL of the longest valid parentheses 
    - they are target nodes because they satisfies a condition (valid parentheses) and is a result of the shortest path (with min number if characters removed)

vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
    if (s.empty()){
        return vector<string>{""};
    }
    
    //need to return all the different longest strings, not the different paths that lead to the valid longest strings. 
    //do not separate visited strings into separate groups visited by prev level and curr level. 
    //If a curr string is already visited, the duplicate instance will produce same shorter strings as the first instance.
    
    vector<string>res;

    queue<string>q;

        int n = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            string curr = q.front();

                    visited.insert(temp);
                    q.push(temp);

            }
