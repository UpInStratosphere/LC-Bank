- Here, we need ALL of the longest valid parentheses (remove min)

- for BFS, queue store unique elements that are visited for the first time (regardless of which path)
    - all nodes in the same level are X steps away from the source (same path length)
    - the same level refers to the nodes that are in the queue in the beginning of each iteration (queue will add additional nodes that further away from the source node while we process the nodes in the current level)
    - same nodes may be visited again by below
        - a different path of the same distance (the same node is already stored in the current level)
        - a different path of a longer distance (the same node was stored in the previous upper level)
    - whether or not the same node should be pushed into the queue depends on
        - if we want to know all the end nodes of the shortest length, repeated node should not be counted
        - if we want to know all the paths that lead to the shortest nodes, then we can push in the same node that were visited in the current level, but not those that were visited in higher levels.
        
- Here, we want all the longest balanced strings (min steps from the original string), thus, we don't re-count nodes that are already visited in the upper levels or in the current level.

```cpp
vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
    if (s.empty()){
        return vector<string>{""};
    }
    
    //need to return all the different longest strings, not the different paths that lead to the valid longest strings. 
    //do not separate visited strings into separate groups visited by prev level and curr level. 
    //If a curr string is already visited, the duplicate instance will produce same shorter strings as the first instance.
    
    vector<string>res;
    unordered_set<string>visited;
    queue<string>q;

    q.push(s); 
    visited.insert(s);
    bool found = false;  //flag to mark when the longest balanced string is found 

    while(!q.empty()){
        int len = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){
            string curr = q.front(); 
            q.pop();
            if (check(curr)){
                res.push_back(curr);
                found = true;
            }
            if (found) continue;
            //generate all shorter strings from curr string with each char as the additional char removed 
            for(int j = 0; j < curr.size(); j++){
                if (curr[j] != '(' && curr[j] != ')') continue;
                string temp = curr.substr(0,j) + curr.substr(j+1);
                if (visited.find(temp) == visited.end()){
                    visited.insert(temp);
                    q.push(temp);
                }
            }
        }
        if (found) return res;
    }
    return res;
}


bool check(const string &s){
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
        if (s[i] == '(') count++;
        else if (s[i] == ')'){
            if (count == 0) return false;
            count--;
        }
