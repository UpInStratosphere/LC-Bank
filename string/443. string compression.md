2 pointer to read and write separately
- for each unique consecutive unique chars read, use local variable to store its char and its freq
- for any freq > 1, converting the freq number into string will result a shorter string 
```cpp
int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
    int read = 0, write = 0; 
    int n = chars.size();
    while(read < n){
        char curr = chars[read];
        int freq = 0;
        while(read < n && chars[read] == curr){
            read++;
            freq++;
        }
        chars[write] = curr;
        if (freq > 1){
            for (auto c : to_string(freq)){
                write++;
                chars[write] = c;
            }
        }
        write++;
    }
    return write;
}
```
