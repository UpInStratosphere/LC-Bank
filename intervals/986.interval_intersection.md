- sorted, disjoint interval
- intersection of these lists is similar to 2-way mergesort
    - if an intersection exists, then it must be with the interval from the other group
- after an intersection is formed, the next interval to be considered must be the one after the smaller ending, because
    - there can only be intersections of both lists still have intervals to be compared
    - intersections won't overlap with each other because none of the intervals overlap with each other
    
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<vector<int>>& B) {
    if (A.empty() || B.empty()) return vector<vector<int>>{};
    vector<vector<int>>res;
    int n = A.size(), m = B.size();
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    
    while (i < n && j < m){
        
        int start = max(A[i][0], B[j][0]);
        int end = min(A[i][1], B[j][1]);
        
        if (start <= end)
            res.push_back(vector<int>{start, end}); 
        
        if (A[i][1] > B[j][1]) 
            j++;
        else
            i++;
    }
    return res;
}
```
