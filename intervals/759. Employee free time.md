Need to find all the merged busy intervals (the time that at least one of the workers is working), then all the gap intervals between each busy group are the free time intervals.


```cpp
struct comp{
    //build min heap based on the starting time of each interval
    bool operator()(vector<int>&a, vector<int>&b){
        if (a[0] != b[0])
            return a[0] > b[0];
        else 
            return a[1] > b[1];
    }
};
vector<Interval> employeeFreeTime(vector<vector<Interval>> schedule) {
    if (schedule.empty()) return vector<Interval>{};
    vector<Interval>res;
    
    priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, comp>pq;
    for (int i = 0; i < schedule.size(); i++)
        pq.push({schedule[i][0].start, schedule[i][0].end, i, 0}); 

    //get the first busy interval group's start
    auto busy = pq.top(); 
    int worker = busy[2];
    int index = busy[3];
    if (busy[3] < schedule[worker].size()-1)
        pq.push({schedule[worker][index+1].start, schedule[worker][index+1].end, worker, index+1});
    
    //unlike merging two sorted intervals, the implementation is simpler
    //create all overlapping busy interval groups (when some of the workers are not free)
    while (!pq.empty()){
        vector<int>curr = pq.top();
        int start = curr[0];
        int end = curr[1];
        int worker = curr[2];
        int index = curr[3];
        pq.pop();
        
        if (start <= busy[1]) //overlapping between the current interval group and this interval
            busy[1] = max(busy[1], end);
        else{ //nonoverlapping, add the free interval and create a new busy interval group
            res.push_back(Interval(busy[1], start));
            busy = curr;
        }
        
        if(index < schedule[worker].size()-1){
             pq.push({schedule[worker][index+1].start, schedule[worker][index+1].end, worker, index+1});
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
