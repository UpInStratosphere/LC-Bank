Current open must be >= closed in the string
- So fill in all the open brackets first, then push in closed as long as the curr open > curr closed.
- Since need all possible such paths, use backtracking to optimize space

```cpp
vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
    vector<string>res;
    if (n == 0) return res;
    string curr = "";
    build(0,0,n,curr,res);
    return res;
}

void build(int open, int closed, int target, string &curr, vector<string>&res){
    if (open > target || closed > open) return;

    if (curr.size() == target * 2){
        res.push_back(curr);
        return;
    }

    if (open < target){
        curr.push_back('(');
        build(open+1, closed, target, curr, res);
        curr.pop_back();
    }

    if (open > closed){
        curr.push_back(')');
        build(open, closed+1, target, curr, res);
        curr.pop_back();
    }
}
```
