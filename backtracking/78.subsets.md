- combination problem where subsets of same elements are counted as 1 
    - for each num, have the option of either include it or exclude it
    - the next num included in the set can only be the next num in the data

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int>curr;
        vector<vector<int>>res;
        build(nums, 0, curr, res); 
        return res;
    }
    
void build(const vector<int>&nums, int index, vector<int>&curr, vector<vector<int>>&res){
    res.push_back(curr);
    for (int i = index; i < nums.size(); ++i){
        curr.push_back(nums[i]);
        
        build(nums, i+1, curr, res);
        
        curr.pop_back(); 
}
```
