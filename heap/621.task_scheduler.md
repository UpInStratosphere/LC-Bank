- only need to figure out the total number of slots that are needed to execute all tasks.
- each segment (n+1 size) of unique task starts with the max-freq task and choose each next task based on decreasing freq
        - if unique tasks run out, check to see if we have any more remaining instances of tasks to execute
          - if yes, then fill the remaining extra slots in current segment with idle slots to satisfy the condition
          - if no, then this is the last segment and the condition is satisfied.

- given each task is a character, there can only be 26 unique characters, so even with priority queue, the total time is Nlog26.

```cpp
int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
    int res = 0;
    unordered_map<char, int>freq;
    priority_queue<int>active;

    for (char c : tasks) 
        ++freq[c];

    for (auto a : freq) //push each unique task into the max heap
        active.push(a.second);

    int cycle = n+1;
    int scheduled = 0;
    vector<int>remain; 
    while (!active.empty()) {
        scheduled = 0; 
        remain.clear(); 
        for (int i = 0; i < cycle && !active.empty(); i++) {
            int cnt = active.top(); active.pop();
            scheduled++;
            cnt--;
            if (cnt > 0) remain.push_back(cnt);  
        }

        if (remain.empty())
            res += scheduled;
        else 
            res += cycle;

        for (auto task : remain)
            active.push(task);
    }
    return res;
}
```
