- only need to figure out the total number of slots that are needed to make n-sized chunks.
    - if curr chunk (besides the last that can have min(remaining, n) has no more remaining tasks to fill out the remaining of the slots in the chunk, fill up with idle slots. Track the number of idle slots.
- each chunk starts with the current max freq task, and will have n+1 of tasks in the chunk (since there need to be n+1 tasks in each chunk)
- for each chunk, fill it will the actual tasks, starting from the most freq task. Then fill the remaining extra slots with idle slots for each chunk besides the last chunk.

```cpp
int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        int res = 0, chunk = n + 1; //each chunk size needs to be n+1
        int total = tasks.size(); //actual tasks number 
        unordered_map<char, int> m;
        priority_queue<int>pq;
        for (char c : tasks) ++m[c]; 
        for (auto a : m) pq.push(a.second); 
        
        while (total > 0) {
            int cnt = 0; //number of actual tasks included in the curr chunk (not including idle slots)
            vector<int>remain; //unique tasks included in the current chunk that need to be used up later
            //if pq runs out while filling out current chunk, then the remaining slots in the chunk must be idle 
            for (int i = 0; i < chunk; ++i) { 
                if (!pq.empty()) { 
                    int temp = pq.top();
                    pq.pop();
                    temp--;
                    if (temp > 0) remain.push_back(temp);
                    ++cnt;
                    total--;
                }
            }
            for (int d : remain) { 
                pq.push(d);
            }
            res += pq.empty()? cnt : chunk; 
            //if empty,then that means curr chunk is the last chunk, so just need to actual tasks added. 
            //if not empty, then curr chunk needs to be the complete size since we still have remaining tasks to be completed.
        }
        return res;
    }
```
