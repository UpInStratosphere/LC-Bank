- same char must have k-1 chars in between. Greedy -> use max heap to place each of the current max freq char in the K-sized substring chunks.
    - each of the curr remaining max freq char will start a K-sized substring
        - if all of the elements in the heap can be used fill a complete chunk of strings without the heap running out while filling out, then construct the next chunk 
        - If curr heap runs out of unique elements to be used while filling the current k-sized chunk AND we still have extra instances of characters from the current chunk that need to be placed later, then that means curr chunk have chars that can't be placed K distance apart. 
    - once a K  size substring is constructed, it does 
    
```cpp
 string rearrangeString(string s, int k) {
    if(k == 0) return s;
    if (s.empty()) return "";
    int n = s.size(); 

    string res = "";
    unordered_map<char, int> dict;
    for(char c : s) 
        dict[c]++;

    priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq; //default is min heap so the largest freq is on top. pair is sorted default by its first element in the pair
    for(auto it = dict.begin(); it != dict.end(); it++){
        pq.push(make_pair(it->second, it->first));
    }
    
    while (n > 0) {
        vector<pair<int, char>>cache; //to store remaining chars after building the next substring chunk
        int count = min(k, n);  //each substring is K-sized or the remaining freq-sized that needs to be processed
        for(int i = 0; i < count; i++){ 
            if(pq.empty()) return "";  //if heap runs out, then that means we need to repeat chars from the curr substring, hence not possible 
            auto tmp = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            res.push_back(tmp.second);
            tmp.first--;
            if(tmp.first > 0) 
                cache.push_back(tmp);
            n--;
        }
        for(auto p : cache) 
            pq.push(p);
    }
    return res;
}
```
