- need to group all elements by their frequency and sort them by groups as determined by their freq.
- Data does not change -> key's frequency is not updated once it is found. So no need to use treemap for fast access/update.
- to extract the elements by their frequency group
    - store them in frequency vectors (each index is the frequency) - bucket sort
    - store them in frequency treemap (each key is freq and value is a container of all chars of that frequency) O(Nlog26) 
        - frequency vector is a pseudo treemap when index are frequency
    - store them in maxheap (items are pair<frequency, container of characters) where items are sorted by key O(Nlog26)

```cpp
string frequencySort(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return "";
    string res = "";

    //O(N) to build frequency mapping
    unordered_map<char,int>freq_map;
    int max_count = 0;
    for (char c : s){
        freq_map[c]++;
        max_count = max(max_count, freq_map[c]);
    }

    //O(N) to group elements into their frequency buckets, this implementation uses a vector's index for each frequency
    vector<vector<char>>buckets(max_count+1, vector<char>{});
    for (auto char_pair:freq_map){
        char curr_char = char_pair.first;
        int curr_count = char_pair.second;
        buckets[curr_count].push_back(char_pair.first);
    }

    //O(N) to traverse the frequency bucket from the back(most) and find topK frequent keys
    for (int i = buckets.size()-1; i >= 1; i--){
        for (auto c : buckets[i]){
            int count = i;
            while(count>0){
                res.push_back(c);
                --count;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
