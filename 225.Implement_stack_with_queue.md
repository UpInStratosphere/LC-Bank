- To maintain the FIFO property with queue, must ensure that each added new element is at the front of the queue
  - to do so, after each new element is added, pop and push all elements from the front to the back of the newly added element
  - invariant : all elements in the queue are reversed BEFORE and AFTER the new element is added. (recursive structure) 
  - As long as the existing elements are already FIFO, as long as we add the reversed elements to the back of the new element, then all elements maintain the FIFO property.
  
```cpp

void push(int x) {
    q.push(x);
    for (int i = 0; i <= lru.size() - 2; i++){ //pop and push all prior (reversed) elements to the back of the new element
        q.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
}

```
