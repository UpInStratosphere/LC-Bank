- The next larger node of the given node:
  - either the leftmost node in the right subtree (if there is one)
  - or a root node for which the given node is the rightmost node of the root node's left subtree. This root would be the last root node from the top root that is still larger than the given node.
  
  ```cpp
  TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        TreeNode* successor = NULL;
        //the next larger node is in the right subtree of the given node
        if (p -> right) {
            successor = p -> right;
            while (successor -> left) {
                successor = successor -> left;
            }
            return successor;
        }
        //the next larger node is lowest root node that is larger than the given node
        while (root) {
            if (p -> val < root -> val) {
                successor = root;
                root = root -> left;
            } else if (p -> val > root -> val) {
                root = root -> right;
            } else { // if root == p, then no lower root node can be greater, thus we can terminate
                break;
            }
        }
        return successor; // we could have a NULL node for the next successor if the given node is the largest node in the tree
