find the digital root of all numbers (num will repeatedly becomes the sum of all of its digits until the new num is < 10)

```cpp
int addDigits(int num) { //LogN
    while(num >= 10){ //since not sure how many iterations would produce the result, use while loop
        //each iteration curr num will becomes the sum of all of its digits
        int temp = 0;
        while (num > 0){
            temp += temp % 10;
            num = num / 10;
        }
        num = temp;
    }
    return num;
}
```
