To have the next larger number, the new number should be increased as little as possible => smallest significant digit
- monotonically decreasing number is the largest it could be with the current digit (since each significant digit has used the largest it could've used)
- the smallest significant digit should be increased to a larger value
    - but such value should only be taken from digits after, and not from front, because we need to preserve the order of the prior digits to ensure the increase in value is as small as possible.
    - The digit is the first one that is smaller than its next neighbor (first dip in value) from the back 
        - as long as there is a dip, we know there are greater values after that can replace it
    - its replacement value is the smallest larger value, which is the first one from the back that is larger than it.
    - after swapping, **the remaining digits after the increased digit should as small as possible**. To do so, reverse the digits

```cpp
void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return;
    int n = nums.size(), i = n-2;

    //find the first smaller element from the back, that's the smallest significant digit that can be modified 
    while(i >= 0){
        if (nums[i] < nums[i+1]) break;
        --i;
    }
    
    //monotonically decreasing digits are the numbers is the biggest permutation there is
    if (i == -1){ //all are sorted in descending ordeer
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        return;
    }

    //the modified value must be taken from the back, find the first one that is bigger than index

    int j = n-1;
    while(j > i){
        if (nums[j] > nums[i]) break;
        j--;
    }
    swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
    
    //everything from the start to index is the next larger one
    //need to make sure that everything after index is as small as it can be since curr number is already larger
    //reverse the remaining digits so they are the smallest
    reverse(nums.begin()+i+1, nums.end()); 
}
```
