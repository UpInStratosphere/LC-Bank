Geometry question:
- 2 points basicallys forms the 2 opposite boundary points of a rectangle.
- to reach it in the min steps, move the points diagonally on the shorter axis (forms a square) because each diagonal step == 2 of the vertical steps, then just travel the remaining difference

```cpp
int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    //moving diagonally from curr to next point to cover the shorter side
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++){
        int short_side = min(abs(points[i][0]- points[i-1][0]), abs(points[i][1] - points[i-1][1]));
        int long_side = max(abs(points[i][0]- points[i-1][0]), abs(points[i][1] - points[i-1][1]));
        int remain = long_side - short_side; //the remaining steps we have to move separately
        res += short_side + remain;
    }
    return res;
}
```
