- since new node is a more significant digit, so it is added to the back of the current list
    - always start from the least significant digit since that's how arithmatic is done
    - since least significant digit is at the front, each new node is added to the back
- any remaining value in either list or in carry can result a new digit to be formed
    - how the data given determines whether we need to access each node from the front or back
    - how the result will be represented determines whether each new node is added to front or back

```cpp
ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
    if (!l1 && !l2) return NULL;
    ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0), *tail = dummy; 
    int carry = 0;
    while (l1 || l2 || carry > 0){
        int sum = 0;
        if (l1){
            sum += l1->val;
            l1 = l1->next;
        }
        if (l2){
            sum += l2->val;
            l2 = l2->next;
        }
        if (carry > 0)
            sum += carry;
        
        listNode* curr = new ListNode (sum % 10);
        tail->next= curr;
        tail = tail->next;
        carry = sum / 10;
    }
    ListNode *head = dummy->next;
    delete dummy;
    return head;
}
```
