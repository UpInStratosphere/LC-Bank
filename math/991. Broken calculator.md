No limits on which operation the number has to take based on its value, so at any internal node (intermediate number in the sequence from source to target) the node can take on either branch.
    - Brute force would be using BFS for each numer we either pick -1 or x2 since we don't know which one would lead to the optimal choice, and count how many levels until we reach the target node
    - but this would cause TLE and integer overflow problem

Optimized greedy: 
    - work backwards from target, and target value can serve as a guide on which the prev intermediate number is
    - if curr value is odd, then can only get here by prev-1, so +1 to get the prev intermediate number
    - if curr value is even, then can only get here by * 2, so /2 to get the prev intermediate number
    - when prev number is < source number, we know that's impossible since we need to start from the source, but that also means we can't get to target value from source with the selected min steps. But thinking in reverse, if we follow the same steps from the source, the new target - curr target would have the same diff as the curr diff:
        - new target - curr target (X-Y) == curr source - new source (Y-X)
     
```cpp
int brokenCalc(int X, int Y) {
        int res = 0;
        while (Y > X) {
            Y = Y % 2 == 1 ? Y + 1 : Y / 2; //Y at each iteration is a prev intermediate value resulted from the source
            res++;
        }
        return res + X - Y;
    }
}
```
