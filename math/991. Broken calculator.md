No limits on which operation the number has to take based on its value, so at any internal node (intermediate number in the sequence from X to Y) the node can take on either operation.
    - Brute force would be using BFS for each numer we either pick -1 or x2 since we don't know which one would lead to the optimal choice, and count how many levels until we reach the target node
    - but this would cause TLE and integer overflow problem

Optimized greedy: 
    - given the operations, only way to increment is double, and to decrement is to -1.
    - default is to to increment until source > target, then the total = increment steps first + decrement steps at the end
    - however, there might be faster ways if we decrement before the increments, so the key becomes on finding out how to most efficiently decrement before increment to beat the default step
        - if we decrement before increment, then for each decrement operation before the following increment operations, we will have total of -1 * following increment operations from total number
    - time = logY (the worst when X is 1)
     
```cpp
int brokenCalc(int X, int Y) {
    if(X > Y){return X - Y;}

    int num_ops = 0; //tracks how many times we doubled the source number
    int mult = 1; //
    while(X < Y){
        X *= 2;
        mult *= 2; //number if we decrement before any increment operations
        num_ops++;
    }

    int diff = X - Y; //amount that Y is more than X
    //calculate how many times we can move a decrement to the front 
    while(diff != 0){
        //do the decrement first so we can decrease total of (-1 * total increment operation) from the final number
        if(diff - mult >= 0){ 
            diff -= mult;
            num_ops++;
        }
        //if diff is < mult, cannot decrement before all increment functions, can only do so after next increment function
        else{  
            mult /= 2;
        }
    }
    return num_ops;
}
```
