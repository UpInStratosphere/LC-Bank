If any intermediate number (before the number is reduced to 1) is already seen, then that means going forward from this duplicate number, we will go in a loop executing all codes until the same number is seen again.


```cpp
bool isHappy(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return true;
    unordered_set<int>visited;
    visited.insert(n);
    while (n > 1){ 
        //get the new intermediate number
        int temp = 0;
        while (n > 0){
            int digit = n % 10;
            temp += digit*digit;
            n = n / 10;
        }
        //found an already seen number, meaning we will be in an infinite loop
        if (visited.find(temp) != visited.end())
            return false; 

        visited.insert(temp);
        n = temp;
    }
    return true;
}
```
