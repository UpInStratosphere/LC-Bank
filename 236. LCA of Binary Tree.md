- logic
  - top-down solution: time o(n), space O(n) from recursion and O(2n) from the path vectors
    - Use DFS+backtracking to traverse the entire tree and find two paths: One from root to node 1, and the other from root to node 2. Then traverse through both vectors, the node before when when vectors have two different nodes is the LCA of two nodes(the lowest common parent of two nodes)
    - the problem with this approach is that we would use two extra space to store the paths, and we would need to use backtracking to build each path. So to to build each path, at worst we would have to travel the entire tree. Then at worst that both nodes are at rightmost subtree. So our vectors will contain all the nodes. 
    
  - bottom up solution: time O(n), space O(n). 
    - if the current node reaches the end, or when the current node equals to one of the target node, we return the node back to its parent, indicating that the current node has found something or found nothing. 
    - each parent node would pass up its left/right children's nodes finding as its own finding or it found nothing (if none of the children found anything).
    - the problem with this code is that we are doing extra work 
    
- code below
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (!root || p == root || q == root) return root; //drilled all the way to the bottom or to a node that matches one of the target. Either way, returning the node would be meaningful. 
        TreeNode *left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode *right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p , q);
        if (left && right) return root; //if this happens, then that means the current node has found both targets in its left and right subtrees, so current node must be the LCA of the target nodes.
        return left ? left : right; 
        //this is the key. If we reach here, then at least one of the left/right is null. So if left is not null, we know right is null. We want the left value, telling us that at least we have found something. If the left is null, right could have found something or could have nothing. But regardless, returning right would be correct (if right found something, we want to know. If right has found nothing, returning right is still correct for the condition of the current node.
        //if both target nodes are in one of the subtree of one of the child node, returning the node early whenever we find one of them is still correct. Because at the end, when we recurse our answer back to the root node, our root node will have one of its child node has a node returned while the other is null, and the last line would return the node that equals to one of the target and returned immediately, which serves as the LCA for both target nodes (since the other one is the subtree of that node).
};
