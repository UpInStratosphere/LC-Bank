# Majority Element
- clarification: the majority element will appear greater than n/2 times
- logic 
  - Counting sort: time O(n), space O(n)
    - use a hashmap (key = element, value = frequency), then return the key while building the hashmap.
  
  - Binary search: time O(nlogn), space O(1)
    - sort the array nlogn. This is the bottleneck of binary search
    - If we know that the array is sorted, and majority exist. Then we can just return the middle element. HOWEVER, if we don't know if the majority element exists. We do know if majority element exist, one of its instance must be at the middle, so we can run binary search for the middle element's first occurence and last occurence. If their total instance > N/2, then we know majority exists. 
 
  - Boyer Moore Technique:O(n) time and O(1) space
    - two steps: 
      - first pass will get the candidate value (one that we initially set to a random value. If the majority exists, at the end, the candidate will be the majority value.
      - second loop, we will iterate through the array again and check if the candidate value appeared > N/2 times. If no, then majority value doesn't exist.
    - Rationale behind the first pass:
      - For every single value that we set as the potential candidate, whenever we meet another value, we cancel both of them out. So IF there is one element that happens more than N/2, N/2 of it will be used to cancel out all other values, and it will remain as the majority. It doesn't matter where in the array the majority value occurs. We can cancel non-majority and non-majority and majority and non-majority. If there is a majority element, if non-majority elements happen earlier in the array, then we will have more counts left over at the end (since non-majority cancelled each other out). If non-majority elements happen later in the array, then we will have less counts left over at the end (we would've tallied up all the majority and have to cancel all the non-majority out). 
    - rationale behind the second pass:
      - the count does not track how many times the majority value occurs in total in the array. It tracks the frequency of the not-cancelled out candidate variable at the end of traversal. So we must verify that the candidate variable is IN FACT the majority element by traversing the array again and track its frequency. 
    ```cpp 
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        int candidate = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int num: nums){
            if (count == 0)
                candidate = num;
            if (candidate == num)
                count += 1;
            else
                count -=1;
        }
        return candidate; 
    ```

   - counting sort: O(N)time and O(N)space
   - Boyer Moore + hashmap O(KN) time and O(K)space
    ```cpp
      vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums, const int k) {
          const int size_n = nums.size();
          vector<int> result;
          
          
          //first phase: traverse the input and each time we cancel out 1 count of K different values
          unordered_map<int, int> cand; //
          for (int i = 0; i < size_n; i++) {
              cand[nums[i]]++;
              if (cand.size() == k) { //hashmap size == max number of N/K majority items + 1
              // every time when we have K values, start cancelling them out with the current value. This ensures that we will cancel out the current value, and possible others in the hashmap. 
                  for (auto it = cand.begin(); it != cand.end(); ) {
                      if (--(it->second) == 0) it = cand.erase(it);
                      else it++;
                  }
              }
          }
          
          //second phase: traverse the array again to make sure that all elements stored in hashmap have > N/K frequency. Because the hashmap may have stored non-N/K majority values because we don't have max number of N/K majority values.
          
          for (auto &item : cand) item.second = 0;
          for (auto &item : nums) {
              if (cand.count(item) > 0) cand[item]++;
          }
          for (auto &item : cand) {
              if (item.second > size_n / k) result.push_back(item.first);
          }
          return result;
      }
      ```
