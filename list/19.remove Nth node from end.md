Nth Node from end == (L-N+1)th node from front, so we need the pointer to be at (L-N)th node
- starting from dummy node (0th node), traverse until pointer ends at Nth node, so it can travel L-N steps to reach last node
- slow pointer starts from 0 (dummy node) and traverse L-N steps, which will ends up at (L-N)th node
- use slow pointer to remove the target node
- remove dummy node (dummy node is used in case removed node is the head node)
- assumes n is valid (where n < L). If this isn't always true, then it's better to just scan the list once to get the length.
```cpp
ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
    if (!head) return NULL;
    int len = 0;
    ListNode *start = head;
    while(start){
        len++;
        start = start->next;
    }
    if (len < n) return NULL;
    ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(-1); dummy->next = head;
    start = dummy;

    for (int i = 0; i < len-n; i++) //pointer would rest at (len-n)th node 
        start = start->next;

    ListNode *temp = start->next;
    start->next = start->next->next;
    delete temp;

    head = dummy->next;
    delete dummy;
    return head;

}
```
