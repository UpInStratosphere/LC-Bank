Use 2 dummy as heads for odd and even list 
- use counter to track whether curr node is odd or even.
- make sure that the last node will ends with NULL.

```cpp
ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
    if (!head) return nullptr;

    ListNode *odd_head = new ListNode (-1), *odd = odd_head;
    ListNode *even_head = new ListNode (-1), *even = even_head;

    ListNode *curr = head;
    int counter = 1;
    while (curr){
        if (counter % 2 == 1){
            odd->next = curr;
            odd = odd->next;
        }
        else{
            even->next = curr;
            even = even->next;
        }
        curr = curr->next;
        counter += 1;

    }
    even->next = NULL;
    odd->next = even_head->next;
    
    head = odd_head->next;
    delete even_head;
    delete odd_head;

    return head;
}
```
