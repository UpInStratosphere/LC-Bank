- each recursive function will connect the nodes in the current level and to the upper level connection node at the last node in the current level
    - if we encounter a lower level, lower level will be connected first before returning back to curr level
    
```cpp
Node* flatten(Node* head) {
        if (!head) return NULL;
        Node *curr = head;
        Node *upper = NULL;
        helper(curr, upper);
        return head;
    }
    
    //recursive function connect all the nodes in curr level and to upper conenction node at last 
    void helper(Node *curr, Node *upper){ 
        while (curr){
            if (curr->child){
                Node *connection = curr->next;
                
                curr->next = curr->child;
                curr->next->prev = curr;
                curr->child = NULL;
                
                helper(curr->next, connection); 
                
                curr = connection;
                continue;
            }
            else if (!curr->next && upper){
                curr->next = upper;
                curr->next->prev = curr;
                return;
            }
            else
                curr = curr->next;
        }
    }
```
