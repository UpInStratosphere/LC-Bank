- key for recursive solution is to know what answer we need from the subproblems to find the answer for curr problem.
- recursive solution
    - uses the subproblem's last node and connect to the resumed node of curr level
- iterative solution
    - each iteration consumes go to the next node (either of curr level, lower level, or upper level)
    
```cpp
Node* flatten(Node* head) {
    if (!head) return NULL;
    helper(head); 
    return head;
}

//function returns the last node of the curr flattened level
Node* helper(Node *curr){ 
    while (curr){
        if (curr->child){
            Node *resume = curr->next;

            curr->next = curr->child;
            curr->next->prev = curr;
            curr->child = NULL;

            curr = helper(curr->next); 
            curr->next = resume;
            if (resume) curr->next->next = curr;
        }
        if (!curr->next)
            break;
        else
            curr = curr->next;
    }
    return curr; //only for syntactical reasons
}
```

```cpp
Node* flatten(Node* head) {
    if (!head) return nullptr;
    Node *curr = head;
    stack<Node*>stk;
    while (curr){
        if (curr->child){ 
            if (curr->next) stk.push(curr->next); //remember the resume node of curr level
            curr->next = curr->child;
            curr->child->prev = curr;
            curr->child = nullptr;
        }
        else if (!curr->next && !stk.empty()){// curr level is finished, go back to upper level 
            curr->next = stk.top();
            curr->next->prev = curr;
            stk.pop();
        }
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    return head;
}
```
