Swap the reversed nodes to the front one by one (reverse one by one).

```cpp
ListNode* reverseBetween(ListNode* head, int m, int n) {
    //use a dummy node because m could be the head node
    ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(-1), *anchor = dummy;
    dummy->next = head;

    //anchor pointer points to the node before the reversed list
    for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) 
        anchor = anchor->next;

    ListNode *tail = anchor->next; //orignal first node of the list will be the last node after reversal
    //swap all the nodes after the first node to the front one by one
    for (int j = 1; j <= n-m; j++){
        ListNode *front = anchor->next; //curr first node at the front
        ListNode *target = tail->next; //node to be moved to the front
        ListNode *remain = tail->next->next; //the head of the remaing nodes to be reversed
        anchor->next = target; //node is moved to the front
        target->next = front; //new front node is connected to the old front node
        tail->next = remain; //connect the remaining nodes
    }
    
    head = dummy->next;
    delete dummy;
    return head;
}
```
