Hashmap method:
- traverse the list and copy each node and store the copied node in a hashmap [real node : copy node]
- traverse the list again and set the pointers of the copied node 
    - hashmap[curr]->next = hashmap[curr->next]
    - hashmap[curr]->random = hashmap[curr->copy]

Threading method:
- traverse the list and make a copy for each node and place it after the real node
- traverse the list again and set the random pointer for each copied node
- use the dummy node as head and extract the copied node and restore the original nodes/

```cpp
Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
    if (!head) return NULL;
    unordered_map<Node*,Node*>hashmap;
    Node *curr = head;
    
    //make the copied node with values only and NULL for the pointers
    while(curr){
        Node *copy = new Node(curr->val, NULL, NULL);
        hashmap[curr] = copy;
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    
    //set the NULL pointers for each copied node after all the copied nodes exist
    curr = head;
    while(curr){
        if (curr->next){ //deals with the last node
            hashmap[curr]->next = hashmap[curr->next];
        }
        if (curr->random){
            hashmap[curr]->random = hashmap[curr->random];
        }
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    return hashmap[head];
}
```

```cpp
Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
    if (!head) return NULL;
    
    //traverse the list and create a copy node for each node and place them after the original node
    Node *curr = head;
    while(curr){
        Node *temp = new Node(curr->val);
        temp->next = curr->next;
        curr->next = temp;
        curr = curr->next->next;
    }
    
    //traverse the list again and set the random pointer for each copied node
    curr = head;
    while(curr){ //curr->next will be valid as long as curr is valid 
        if (curr->random){
            curr->next->random = curr->random->next;
        }
        curr = curr->next->next;
    }
    
    //separate the copied list from the original list
    Node *dummy = new Node(0), *copy_head = dummy;
    curr = head;
    while(curr){ //curr->next will be valid as long as curr is valid 
        copy_head->next = curr->next;
        curr->next = curr->next->next;
        copy_head = copy_head->next;
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    
    copy_head = dummy->next;
    delete dummy;
    return copy_head;
}
```
