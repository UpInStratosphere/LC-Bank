Reversing the second half, check, then reverse back is one way to save space.
    - but in a concurrent system (where the list is accessed by multiple threads and processes), the list needs to be locked until this check is over, otherwise the list is broken when other threads is accessing the modified data. 
        - cannot have shared acess to reading the data 
    - This is a limitation for all in-place algorithms, which is why allowing the original data to be modified without mutex protection is a bad practice unless the intention for the algorithm is to modify the data.
    
    
```cpp
bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
    if (!head) return true;
    stack<ListNode*>stk;
    ListNode *curr = head;
    while(curr){
        stk.push(curr);
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    curr = head;
    while(curr){
        if (curr->val != stk.top()->val)
            return false;
        stk.pop();
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    return true;
}
```
