- one big node got moved to the front and one small node got moved to the back, they may/may not be next to each other.
- when using inorder, the big node will be noticed whenever it is larger than the curr node. the smaller node will be noticed whenever it is smaller than the prev node. 
  - if two nodes are not consecutive, then prev node is the wrong node in the first pair found, but in the second pair it is the right node. So do not assign the first node the second time. 
  - if two nodes are not consecutive, second node will be right in the first pair found, but it will be overwrite by the wrong node in the second pair. So assigning the second node the second time is fine.
  
```cpp
 if (!root) return;
    TreeNode *prev = nullptr;
    TreeNode *first = nullptr, *second = nullptr;
    stack<TreeNode*>stk;
    while(!stk.empty() || root){
        while(root){
            stk.push(root);
            root = root->left;
        }
        TreeNode *curr = stk.top();
        stk.pop();
        if (prev && prev->val >= curr->val){
            if (!first) first = prev;  
            second = curr;    
        }
        prev = curr;
        root = curr->right;  
    }
    swap(first->val, second->val);
}
```
