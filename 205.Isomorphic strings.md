Logic
- we need to determine whether the two strings have the property of: if character A appears the first time in string1, character B appears the first time as well, and A and B appears the same time ONLY. So we can hashmap the last occurence index of each character in both strings. If the *last* occurence of two characters are not the same, then that means one of them is mismatched to different character. 
- We can either map the characters from each string to the index, or we can use a vector to substitute for the character's value to save space. 
- code below
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        char map_s[128];
        char map_t[128];
        int len = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++){
            map_s[i] = -1;
            map_t[i] = -1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        {
            if (map_s[s[i]]!=map_t[t[i]]) return false;
            map_s[s[i]] = i;
            map_t[t[i]] = i;
        }
        return true;    
    }
};
```
