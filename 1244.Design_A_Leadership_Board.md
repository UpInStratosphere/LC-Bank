- common patterns : keys will frequently update their values, and need to know the top K keys based on the values.
- Top K elements in streaming form usually stored in a heap, but the KEY DIFFERENCE here is existing element's value can be updated. Updating an existing key's value need to find and delete the existing element in the heap and insert the same key with an updated value. 
  - Heap cannot handle element lookup and deletion efficiently without checking each one by popping. 
  - ordered map/set is another that keeps items sorted in order. The only problem is that it cannot maintain duplicated elements (so each key must be unique)

```cpp
class Leaderboard {
private:
    unordered_map<int,int>entry; //[id: score]
    map<int, unordered_set<int>>topK; //[score : all ids with the score] stores all the scores ascendingly 
    
public:
    Leaderboard() {
        
    }
    
    void addScore(int playerId, int score) { // O(1) + O(logN) from updating the topK with the new score
        if (entry.find(playerId) != entry.end()){
            int old_score = entry[playerId];
            topK[old_score].erase(playerId);
            if (topK[old_score].empty()) 
                topK.erase(old_score);
            entry[playerId] += score;
            int new_score = entry[playerId];
            topK[new_score].insert(playerId);
        }
        else{
            entry[playerId] = score;
            topK[score].insert(playerId);
        }  
    }
    
    int top(int K) { // O(K) since we are moving iterators 
        int count = K;
        int res = 0;
        for (auto it = topK.rbegin(); count > 0 && it != topK.rend(); it++){
            int curr_score = it->first;
            int players = it->second.size(); 
            while (count > 0 && players > 0){
                res += curr_score;
                players--;
                count--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    void reset(int playerId) { //O(logN) from deleting the player's score in the score treemap 
        int old_score = entry[playerId];
        entry[playerId] = 0;
        topK[old_score].erase(playerId);
        if(topK[old_score].empty())
            topK.erase(old_score);
        topK[0].insert(playerId); //this could be omitted here since we only want the sum of topK scores but these players have no scores, but if we want to know the topK players, then we need to keep this.
    }
};
```
