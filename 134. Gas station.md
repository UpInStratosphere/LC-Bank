- logic
  - If the total gas gained at all stations < total gas needed to travel to the all the stations. Then we know the round trip is not possible. If the total gas gained > total gas spent, then we know that the trip is at least possbile.
  - If the trip is possible, then we need to know where to start as the starting position to make the trip possible. 
  - at each station, we first find the net gain in gas at THAT station. 
    - If the net at a specific station + the existing gas in the tank > 0, then that means we have enough gas to travel to the next station so we don't have to reset the starting station (it is still a possible starting station contender), since current gas tracks how much gas our tank currently has from the starting station to the current station. 
    - If the net at a specific station + existing gas in the tank < 0, then that means from the last marked starting position, there is no way to go to the next station. So we have to reset the staring position of the trip. 
    - if at the end of the trip, our total gas (tracks the total gas from station 0) >= 0, then that means we can make the trip. We just don't start at station 0. Instead, we start at the last marked starting position, and use the remaining gas left in the last station and circle back around 
    
- code below
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = gas.size();
        int total_tank = 0, curr_tank = 0, starting_station = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            curr_tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (curr_tank < 0){ //means the last marked start cannot be correct.
                starting_station = i + 1; //reset the start to the next station
                curr_tank = 0; //also reset the current tank amount to 0 to start afresh
              }
        }
        if (total_tank < 0) return -1; 
        return starting_station;
    }
};
```
