- Multi-branched recursion: break-down the current problem into 2 or more independent (non-overlapping) subproblems, each subproblems is solved recurrently and then combine the answers from all subproblems whenever they return their answers.
    - for each level, only concerned with how to use the answers from current subproblems to solve the current problem.


```cpp
int countShips(Sea sea, vector<int> topRight, vector<int> bottomLeft) {
    //each vertex is [row:col]
    int top = topRight[0], right = topRight[1], bottom = bottomLeft[0], left = bottomLeft[1];
    
    if (left > right || bottom > top) return 0;

    bool res = sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft); //determine whether the current problem needs to be further broken down

    if (res == false) return 0;
    if(res == true && top == bottom && left == right) return 1; 

    //if here, then current rectangle has ships but we don't know how many since the rectangle is too big
    //so we divide the current space into 4 quadrants and combine them together when they are all found
    return countShips(sea,  {top, (left + right)/2}, {(bottom + top)/2+1, left} ) + 
        countShips(sea,  {top, right}, {(bottom + top)/2 + 1, (left +right) / 2 + 1} ) +
        countShips(sea,  {(top + bottom)/2, (left+right)/2}, {bottom, left } ) + 
        countShips(sea,  {(top + bottom)/2, right}, {bottom, (left+right)/2 + 1 } );
}
```
