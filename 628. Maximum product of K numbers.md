Max Product of 2/3/K numbers 
  - logic
    - The core procedure for this question is how to deal with input with mixed negative and positive integers. Because the product of two small (negative) integers could have a bigger result than 2 larger (positive) integers. 
    - if the input is all negative/positive integers, then we would pick all the integers from one side
      - in an all positive sequence, we take all from the right side (biggest K integers).
      - in an all negative sequence
        - if K is even, we take K integers from the left side (to have the largest positive product) - General algorithm applies
        - if K is odd, we take K integers from the right side (to have the smallest negative product)
    - if the sequence is mixed
      - if K is odd, then pick from the right, then to find K-1 left and keep picking larger of the left/right pairs(so each time we pick two elements).
      - if K is even, keep picking larger of the left/right pairs

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumProduct(vector<int>& nums, int K) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 2) return 0;
        int l = 0, r = n-1;
        int product = 1;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); 
        if(K % 2 == 1 && nums[l]*nums[r] >= 0){
            while (K > 0){
              product *= nums[r];
              r--;
            }
            return product; 
        }
        
        while(K > 0) { 
            if(K % 2 == 1) {
                product *= nums[r];
                r--;
                K--;
            }
            else {
                if(nums[r]*nums[r-1] > nums[l]*nums[l+1]){
                    product *= nums[r] * nums[r-1];
                    r -= 2;
                }
                else{
                    product *= nums[l] * nums[l+1];
                    l += 2;
                }
                K -=2;
            }
        }
        return product;
    }
};
