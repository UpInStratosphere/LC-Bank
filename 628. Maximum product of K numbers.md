Max Product of 2/3/K numbers 
- logic
  - The core procedure for this question is how to deal with input with mixed negative and positive integers. Because the product of two small (negative) integers could have a bigger result than 2 larger (positive) integers. 
    
- find the max product of 2 numbers.
  - scan through the input once and keep track of max 2 and min 2. The max product will be either of max 2 or min 2.
- find max product of 3 numbers
  - sort the input
  - pick the product of either the top 3 elements OR min 2 elements and top element
    - if 3 negatives, top 3 
    - if 2 negatives, top 3 or min 2 and top 1
    - if 1 negative, top 3

Find the max product of K numbers
  - sort the input
  - if the input is all negative/positive integers, then we would pick all the integers from one side
    - in an all positive sequence, we take all from the right side (biggest K integers).
    - in an all negative sequence
      - if K is even, we take K integers from the left side (to have the largest positive product) - General algorithm applies
        - if K is odd, we take K integers from the right side (to have the smallest negative product)
      - if the sequence is mixed
        - if K is odd, then pick from the right, then to find K-1 left and keep picking larger of the left/right pairs(so each time we pick two elements).
        - if K is even, keep picking larger of the left/right pairs
- code below:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumProduct(vector<int>& nums, int K) { 
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 2) return 0;
        int l = 0, r = n-1;
        int product = 1;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); 
        if(K % 2 == 1 && nums[l]*nums[r] >= 0){ //whenever K is odd and all input are +/-, pick all large numbers)
            while (K > 0){
              product *= nums[r];
              r--;
            }
            return product; 
        }
        
        while(K > 0) { //else, whenever input are mixed and K is odd/even* or whenever input is all negative but K is even, we need to start taking the larger pairs from either end)
            if(K % 2 == 1) {
                product *= nums[r];
                r--;
                K--;
            }
            else {
                if(nums[r]*nums[r-1] > nums[l]*nums[l+1]){
                    product *= nums[r] * nums[r-1];
                    r -= 2;
                }
                else{
                    product *= nums[l] * nums[l+1];
                    l += 2;
                }
                K -=2;
            }
        }
        return product;
    }
};
```
