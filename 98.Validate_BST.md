- inorder is the bugfree, traverse the BST with inorder while keeping variable prev, if curr node is ever <= prev node, then the current tree is not BST
- postorder also works by checking each node to see if the subtree with the node is a BST, and a subtree is only BST whenever both of its children subtrees are BST and curr tree nodes satisfy BST property. Traversing the tree from bottom up visit each node once and build the answers with subtrees on top of each other.

```cpp
bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return true;
    TreeNode *prev = NULL;
    stack<TreeNode*>stk;
    while(root || !stk.empty()){
        while(root){
            stk.push(root);
            root = root->left;
        }
        TreeNode *curr = stk.top();
        stk.pop();
        if (prev && prev->val >= curr->val)
            return false;
        prev = curr;
        root = curr->right; //if there is no right node, we skip pushing for the next iteration 
    }
    return true;
}
```
