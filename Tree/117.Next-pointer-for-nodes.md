- BFS would be the core algorithm to use, we need to use the queue because we don't know the tree structure (we dont know how many children nodes each of the current node has until we visit each parent node). With BFS, we produce the next pointers for the this level's nodes we are currently visitng.
- By using prev established pointers to connect the current level's nodes, we can connect the current level nodes by using its top level parent nodes. We don't need to use a queue.

```cpp
ListNode *connect(ListNode *root){
    ListNode *leftmost = new ListNode(), *curr = leftmost, *top = root;
    while(top){
        //used to connect the node's next pointers
        if (top->left){
            curr->next = top->left;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        if (top->right){
            curr->next = top->right;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        //used to either traverse the top level or move top level down one level
        if (top->next){
            top = top->next;
        }
        else {
            top = leftmost->next;
            leftmost->next = NULL;
            curr = leftmost;
        }
    }
    delete leftmost;
    return root;
}
```
