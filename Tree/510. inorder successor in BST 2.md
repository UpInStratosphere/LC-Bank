Same logic as before
- but if no direct access to root but access to parent, to find the next larger node at the top, we know that the curr node must be a left child node or its closest ancestor must be a left child node of a root, then that root is the next inorder successor.

```cpp
Node* inorderSuccessor(Node* node) {
    Node *successor = NULL;
    
    if (node->right){ //successor is the smallest node in the right subtree
        Node *curr = node->right;
        while (curr->left)
            curr = curr->left;
        return curr;
    }
    else{ //successor is the closest top node for which the node or node's ancestor is a left child node
        Node *curr = node;
        
        while (curr->parent && curr->parent->right == curr) {
            curr = curr->parent;
        }
        
        return curr->parent;
    }
    return successor; //could happen if the target node is root node that has no right subtree
}
```
