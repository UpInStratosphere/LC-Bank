Next greater node of the target node must 
- EITHER be in leftmost node in the right subtree 
- OR the upper parent root that contains the target node in its left subtree
    - the target node or the next closest ancestor is the left child
    - meaning the parent root is the last root > target node

```cpp
Node* inorderSuccessor(Node* node) {
    if (node->right){ 
        Node *curr = node->right;
        while (curr->left)
            curr = curr->left;
        return curr;
    }

    Node *curr = node;
    while (curr->parent){
        if (curr == curr->parent->left) 
            return curr->parent;
        else
            curr = curr->parent;
    }
    return NULL;
}
```
