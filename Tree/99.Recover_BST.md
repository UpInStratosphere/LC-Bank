- one large node got moved to the front and one small node got moved to the back, they may/may not be a consecutive pair.
    - the misplaced large node will be placed before its original position in the sorted array, and will be detected as the curr node is <= prev node (prev node is the misplaced large node)
    - the misplaced small node will be placed after its original position in the sorted array, and will be detected as the curr node is <= prev node (curr node is the misplaced small node)
  
```cpp
 if (!root) return;
    TreeNode *prev = nullptr;
    TreeNode *first = nullptr, *second = nullptr;
    stack<TreeNode*>stk;
    while(!stk.empty() || root){
        while(root){
            stk.push(root);
            root = root->left;
        }
        TreeNode *curr = stk.top();
        stk.pop();
        if (prev && curr->val <= prev->val){
            if (!first) 
                first = prev;  
            second = curr;    
        }
        prev = curr;
        root = curr->right;  
    }
    swap(first->val, second->val);
}
```
