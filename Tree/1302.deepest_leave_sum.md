- postorder traversal
    - calculate the the depth of the deepest leaf node in the tree and the leaf node's sums
    - at each leaf node, return its value and 1 for its depth.
- if the current left subtree has deeper leaf nodes, then the right subtree's leaf nodes won't be included in the leaf nodes sum for the current tree. Same logic for the right subtree
    - the depth of the leaf node FOR the overall root will be the same whether it is done via preorder or postorder
    
    
  
```cpp
int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        return DFS(root).first;
    }

//pair<sum,depth> of the deepest leaf nodes for the current node's tree
pair<int,int> DFS(TreeNode *node){
    if (!node) return {0,0};
    if (!node->left && !node->right){
        return {node->val, 1};
    }
    auto left = DFS(node->left);
    auto right = DFS(node->right);
    if (left.second < right.second)
        return {right.first, right.second+1};
    if (left.second > right.second)
        return {left.first, left.second+1};
    return {left.first+right.first, left.second+1};
}
```
