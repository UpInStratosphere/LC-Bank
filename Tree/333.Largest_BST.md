- check each subtree and try to see if it is a BST, then pick the largest BST subtree from the entire tree.
    - if checked from the root, then for each subtree we need to run inorder on it. worst case is N^2 for a skewed tree
- if checked from the bottom and each time use the already calculated children subtrees on the bottom to determine if the upper tree is BST, then each node only has to be checked once. 
    - since we are drilling down to the children trees, the parameters for each subtree will be updated as we bubble up with each bigger subtree.
    - at each subtree, we needs the min and max from both left and right children nodes subtrees

```cpp
 int largestBSTSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        int res = 0, mn = 0, mx = 0;
        isValidBST(root, mn, mx, res);
        return res;
    }
 
 int isValidBST(TreeNode *node, int &mn, int &mx, int &res){
    if (!node) return 0; //if it's an empty node, it should not prevent its parent node from being a BST
    
    int left_mn = 0, left_mx = 0;
    int is_left = isValidBST(node->left, left_mn, left_mx, res);
    
    int right_mn, right_mx = 0;
    int is_right = isValidBST(node->right, right_mn, right_mx, res);
    
    if (is_left != -1 && is_right != -1){ //curr tree can only be a BST if both of its children nodes subtrees are BSTs
        if (node->left && left_mx >= node->val)
            return -1;
        if (node->right && right_mn <= node->val)
            return -1;
        int curr = is_left + is_right + 1;
        res = max(res, curr);
            
        mn = node->left? left_mn : node->val;
        mx = node->right? right_mx : node->val;
        return curr;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
