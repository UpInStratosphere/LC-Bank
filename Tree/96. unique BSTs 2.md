DP[i] = the number of BSTs of all previous numbers as the root of a BST
for each number i (range from 1 to n)
- each number j before i can be used as a root of a BST
- left child nodes = numbers before j
- right child nodes = numbers after j

```cpp
int numTrees(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    vector<int>res (n+1, 0);
    res[0] = 1; //1 way to make a BST if there are no nodes
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++){ //each of these will be a root
            res[i] += res[j-1] * res[i-j];
        }
    }
    return res[n];
}
```
