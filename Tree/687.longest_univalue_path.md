- for each node from the bottom up, we will use the node as the root of a path
    - the solution must use one of the node as the root, so we will try out each node as the root
    - for each node, if the path include the root, then the path must include the children nodes themselves. 
    - so it the children node val != node val, then the children path cannot be extended to the current node

```cpp
int longestUnivaluePath(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    int res = 0;
    check(root, res);
    return res;
}


int check(TreeNode *node, int &res){
    if (!node) return 0; 
    
    int left_path = check(node->left, res);
    if (node->left && node->left->val == node->val)
        left_path+=1;
    else                                            //if not the same, then the left path is thrown away
        left_path = 0;
    
    
    int right_path = check(node->right, res);
    if (node->right && node->right->val == node->val)  
        right_path += 1;
    else
        right_path = 0;                             //if not the same, then the right path is thrown away
    
    int curr_path = left_path + right_path; 
    res = max(res, curr_path);
    
    return max(left_path, right_path);              //path length returned must include the current node 
}
```
