- each node in the level will have a X and Y coord (similar to a point in a cartesian plane). 
    - nodes will be traversed from top to bottom (from the smaller to the larger Y level nodes)
- We are grouping nodes by their X level. Because we will visit the top level nodes in an group before lower level, and left to right, we don't need to do extra work other than merely visit each node using level order traversal and put each node in their respective level.
- the more intuitive answer is using an ordered map that uses vertical level as key and put each node in its level.
    - but given that the vertical levels are formed continuouly, we can track the min/max level using hashmap.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> verticalOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<vector<int>>res;
    if(!root) return res;
    unordered_map<int,vector<int>>col_nodes; 
    
    int min_level = 0, max_level = 0;
    queue<pair<int,TreeNode*>>todo;
    todo.push({0, root});
    
    while(!todo.empty()){
        int level = todo.front().first;
        TreeNode *node = todo.front().second;
        todo.pop();
        
        min_level = min(min_level, level);
        max_level = max(max_level, level);
        
        col_nodes[level].push_back(node->val);

        if (node->left)
            todo.push({level-1, node->left});
      
        if (node->right)
            todo.push({level+1, node->right});
    }
    
    //the vertical levels are simply used to determine the relative order of all the nodes
    //not actually mapping the vertical level to each of the result
    for (int i = min_level; i <= max_level; i++){ 
        res.push_back(col_nodes[i]);
    }
    return res;
}
```
