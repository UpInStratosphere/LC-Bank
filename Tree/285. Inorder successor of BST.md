next greater node must be : Because of the BST characteristic, can traverse and retrive the answer in logN
- in the right subtree (smallest in the right subtree => keep going left)
- in the upper nodes (last root from the top that is > target node)

```cpp
TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
    if (!root) return nullptr;
    TreeNode* successor = NULL;
    
    //the next larger node is in the right subtree of the given node
    if (p -> right) {
        successor = p -> right;
        while (successor -> left) {
            successor = successor -> left;
        }
        return successor;
    }

    //if no right subtree, then the next larger node is the smallest root node (from the top) that is larger than target node
    while (root) {
        if (p -> val < root -> val) {
            successor = root;
            root = root -> left;
        } else if (p -> val > root -> val) {
            root = root -> right;
        } else { // if root == p, then next greater is found from the top
            break;
        }
    }
    return successor;
}
```
