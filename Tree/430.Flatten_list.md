- each recursive helper function would choose one of the below functions to implement for each visited node
    - curr has a child node, go down to lower level and link nodes in that level first 
    - curr is the last node in its level, go up connect to the lower level last node to the upper level next node 
    - curr node has nothing (neither the last node in its level nor has a child node), traverse to the next node

- in stack solution, we store the next node of the current level in the stack ancillary ddata instead of passing the next node as the second parameter in the helper function

```cpp
Node* flatten(Node* head) {
    if (!head) return NULL;
    Node *curr = head;
    Node *upper = NULL;
    helper(curr, upper);
    return head;
}

void helper(Node *curr, Node *upper){
    while (curr){
        if (curr->child){ 
            Node *todo = curr->next;
            curr->next = curr->child;
            curr->next->prev = curr;
            curr->child = NULL;
            helper(curr->next, todo);
            curr = todo;
            continue;
        }
        else if (!curr->next && upper){
            curr->next = upper;
            curr->next->prev = curr;
            return;
        }
        curr = curr->next;
    }
}
```
