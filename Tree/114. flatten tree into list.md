The list needs to be the nodes in preorder fashion
- for each node as root, should have the left and right trees flattened before adding the current node to the front
- for the curr node, the curr flattened tree's list needs the list from the children trees before can work on curr tree

flatten function
- if left tree, attach right tree to the end of it (if right tree exist)
    - for each tree, we need the pthe start and end node of the list
        - start is the root, end is the answer we need to return
- return the end of the flattened list 
    - if there was right subtree, then right tail is the end

```cpp
void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    helper(root);
}

TreeNode *helper(TreeNode *curr){ //takes subtree root node and returns the end node of subtree's flattened list
    //base case: nothing to flatten
    if (!curr) return NULL;
    if (!curr->left && !curr->right)
        return curr;

    //recursive case for internal nodes (have at least 1 child tree to flatten)
    TreeNode *left_tail = helper(curr->left);
    TreeNode *right_tail = helper(curr->right);

    //connect the flattened lists together
    if (left_tail){
        left_tail->right = curr->right; //if curr right is NULL, then nothing was changed since leaf node already points to NULL
        curr->right = curr->left;
        curr->left = NULL;
    }

    //return the end node of the current tree's flatten's list, right tail is prioritized before left 
    return right_tail ? right_tail : left_tail; 
}
```
