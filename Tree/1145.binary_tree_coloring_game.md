- Each player can only expand from the first node that they pick.
    - The first player colors a node, there are at most 3 nodes connected to this node: its left, its right and its parent.
    - The second player can choose any of them as root of his own subtree, and the whole subtree will be his.
- after first node, players cannot take nodes crossing the other player's nodes.
    
```cpp
bool btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode* root, int n, int x) {
        bool win = false;
        check(root, x, win, n);
        return win;
    }

//returns the total nodes count for curr node's tree

int check(TreeNode *node, int x, bool&win, int n){
    //base case
    if (!node) return 0;

    //recursive case
    int left_tree = check(node->left, x, win, n);
    int right_tree = check(node->right, x, win, n);
    int remain = n - (left_tree+right_tree+1); 
    
    //only need to check if curr node is the first node that player1 chose
    if (node->val == x){
        if (remain > left_tree+right_tree+1) win = true;
        else if (left_tree > remain+right_tree+1) win = true;
        else if (right_tree > left_tree+remain+1) win = true;        
    }

    return left_tree+right_tree+1;
}
```
