- Each player can only expand from the first node that they pick.
    - So for the second player to win, it needs to choose root of X's left subtree, or right subtree, OR the parent of X to maximize the total nodes they can pick
    - so for each node(until we reach x) from bottom left, find the total nodes in its left tree, right tree, and remaining nodes in the tree outside of nodes of X, one of these node will let player 2 win the game.
    
```cpp
bool btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode* root, int n, int x) {
        bool win = false;
        check(root, x, win, n);
        return win;
    }
    
int check(TreeNode *node, int x, bool&win, int n){
    if (!node) return 0;
    int left_tree = check(node->left, x, win, n);
    int right_tree = check(node->right, x, win, n);
    
    //curr rooted tree nodes = left_tree+right_tree+1;
    
    if (node->val == x){
        int outside = n - (left_tree+right_tree+1); 
        win = (outside > left_tree+right_tree) || (left_tree > outside+right_tree) || (right_tree > left_tree+outside);        
    }

    return left_tree+right_tree+1;
}
```
