for each of the curr node as root, find the left and right path to see if it is a complete tree
- if complete tree, then this tree's nodes can be found by using the complete feature of the tree
- if not complete, then curr tree's total nodes == left subtree + right subtree + 1

function
- 2 base cases : when the curr tree is NULL or curr tree is complete
- recursive case : when the curr tree isn't complete and need to find left and right tree separately
- total time = (LogN)^2

```cpp
 int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    //base cases : NULL node or when curr tree is complete
    if (!root) return 0;
    int left_path = 0, right_path = 0;
    TreeNode *temp1 = root, *temp2 = root;
    while(temp1){
        left_path+=1;
        temp1 = temp1->left;
    }
    while(temp2){
        right_path+=1;
        temp2 = temp2->right;
    }
    if (left_path == right_path) return pow(2, left_path)-1;

    //recursive case
    int res = 1;
    res += countNodes(root->left);
    res += countNodes(root->right);
    return res;
}
```
