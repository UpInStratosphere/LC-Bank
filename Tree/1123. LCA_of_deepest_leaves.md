- depth => length of the path (number of nodes) from the root to the leaf node
- each function determines whether the lca is the curr node or of the children subtree function
    - if the left child tree is deeper, then the lca of deepest leaves in curr tree must be the lca returned by the left child subtree.
    - if the right child tree is deeper, then the lca of deepest leaves in curr tree  must be the lca returned by the right child subtree.
    - if both subtree have the same depth, then lca of the deepest leaves in curr tree is the current node.
- because nodes are visited from bottom up, so lca will be made this way
```cpp

TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return NULL;
    auto ans = helper(root);
    return ans.first;
}

//returns the lca and the deepest leaf node depth for the curr node's tree
//the depth refers to the number of nodes to the curr node as root
pair<TreeNode*, int> helper(TreeNode* node) {

    //base case: no node or leaf node
    if (!node) return {NULL, 0};
    if (!node->left && !node->right)
        return {node, 1};

    //recursive case: using the children node's subtree to get the curr tree's answer
    auto left = helper(node->left);
    auto right = helper(node->right);

    //if left subtree has deeper leaf nodes, LCA doesn't consider right subtree's leaf nodes
    if (left.second > right.second)
        return {left.first, left.second + 1};

    //same logic for right subtree
    if (left.second < right.second)
        return {right.first, right.second + 1};
    
    //if both subtrees have the same deepest leaf nodes, then curr node is the LCA because deepest leaf nodes from both subtree are considered
    return {node, left.second + 1};
}
```
