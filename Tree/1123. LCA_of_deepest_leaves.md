- depth => length of the path (number of nodes) from the root to the leaf node
- each function determines whether the lca is the curr node or of the children subtree function
    - if the left child tree is deeper, then the lca of deepest leaves in curr tree must be the lca returned by the left child subtree.
    - if the right child tree is deeper, then the lca of deepest leaves in curr tree  must be the lca returned by the right child subtree.
    - if both subtree have the same depth, then lca of the deepest leaves in curr tree is the current node.
- because nodes are visited from bottom up, so lca will be made this way
```cpp

TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        return helper(root).first;
    }
    
    //returns the depth and lca of each subtree 
    pair<TreeNode*, int> helper(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return {NULL, 0};
        if (!node->left && !node->right)
            return {node, 1};
        
        auto left = helper(node->left);
        auto right = helper(node->right);
        
        //if left subtree is depper, then lca won't involve curr node or right subree
        if (left.second > right.second)
            return {left.first, left.second + 1};
        
        //if right subtree is deeper, then lca won't involve curr node or left subtree
        if (left.second < right.second)
            return {right.first, right.second + 1};
        
        return {node, left.second + 1};
    }
```
