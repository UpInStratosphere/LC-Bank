- depth => length of the path (number of nodes) from the root to the leaf node
- the deepest leaves are the leaf nodes of the longest paths
- return the lca from bottom up. 
    - if the left child tree is deeper, then the lca of deepest leaves must be the left child node,
    - if the right child tree is deeper, then the lca of deepest leaves must be the right child node
    - if both subtree have the same depth, then lca of the deepest leaves is the current node.
- for each node, we return the depth of longset path from this node to the leaf node
    - if the node is leaf node, return itself
    - if node is an internal node, the lca depends on the deeper subtrees 
```cpp

TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        return helper(root).first;
    }
    
    //calculates the depth and lca of each subtree from bottom up
    pair<TreeNode*, int> helper(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return {NULL, 0};
        if (!node->left && !node->right)
            return {node, 1};
        
        auto left = helper(node->left);
        auto right = helper(node->right);
        
        if (left.second > right.second)
            return {left.first, left.second + 1};
        
        if (left.second < right.second)
            return {right.first, right.second + 1};
        
        return {node, left.second + 1};
    }
```
