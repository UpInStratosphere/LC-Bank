Two pointers
- fast pointer to traverse and read the number
- slow pointer to overwrite the curr index with the read number that satisfies a condition


```cpp
 void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return;
    //fill in all non-zero numbers with their relative positions conserved
    int write = 0, n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        if (nums[i] != 0){
            nums[write] = nums[i];
            write++;
        }
    }
    //fill in the rest of the numbers as zeroes
    for (int j = write; j < n; ++j){
        nums[j] = 0;
    }
}
```
