Current largest element will reside at either end, pick the larger one from the end and move toward mid (smaller elements).
- Both pointers refer to the numbers not yet processed. So if the loop is left < right, only one will be processed and the other one will be skipped at the end.

```cpp
vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& A) {
    vector<int>res;
    if (A.empty()) return res;
    int left = 0, right = A.size()-1;
    while(left <= right){
        if (abs(A[right]) >= abs(A[left])){
            int curr = A[right] * A[right];
            res.push_back(curr);
            right--;
        }
        else{
            int curr = A[left] * A[left];
            res.push_back(curr);
            left++;
        }
    }
    reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
    return res;
}
```
