- find pivot then search each divided subarrays separately
- when using binary search, split the array into 2 separate segments, one that fits the target condition, and one that doesn't
    - here, because we know the array, if rotated, was a single increasing array, therefore we know the first number smaller than the target will be the smallest of the entire array. And that can be used to divide the array into 2 separate segments
```cpp
 int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    if (nums.empty()) return -1;
    int n = nums.size();
    //target condition: find the first num < base.
    int left = 0, right = n-1, index = -1, base = nums[right];
    while (left <= right){
        int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
        if (nums[mid] < target){ 
            index = mid;
            left = mid+1;
        }
        else
            right = mid-1;
    }
    if (index == -1)
        index = n-1;
    int first = binarySearch(nums, 0, pivot-1);
    if (first != -1) return first;
    int second = binarySearch(nums, pivot, n-1);
    if (second != -1) return second;
    return -1;
}

int binarySearch(const vectot<int>&nums, int left, int right, int target){
    while (left <= right){
        int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
        if (nums[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        else if (nums[mid] < target)
            left = mid+1;
        else
            right = mid-1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
