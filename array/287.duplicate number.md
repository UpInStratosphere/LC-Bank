If arrays can be read/written, then can modify the array by swapping since each value can be swapped into an index
    - the first visited value that's not in its index would be the duplicate value
If array is read only, then must use fast/slow pointer to detect the cycle
    - each value can be used as next index to be visited
    - some indices will have duplicate values and will form a cycle

- 2 steps:
    - first time slow and fast meet when they are traversing at their own speed would be somewhere in the cycle.
    - reset fast pointer to start, then traverse both one step at a time, the meeting point would be the duplicated number.
    
```cpp
int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() < 1) 
        return -1;
     
    int slow = nums[0];
    int fast = nums[nums[0]];
    
    //first time meet within the cycle
    while (slow != fast){
        slow = nums[slow]; 
        fast = nums[nums[fast]]; 
    }
   
    //second time meeting index after resetting slow pointer would be the cycle entrance (duplicate value)
    slow = 0;
    while (fast != slow){
        fast = nums[fast];
        slow = nums[slow];
    }
    return fast;
}
```
