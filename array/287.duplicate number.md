- values do not exceed the index amount
    - each value can be used as an index for the next number to be traversed
- because there are duplicate values, then there must be a cycle if we use the values as the next index

- 2 steps:
    - first time slow and fast meet when they are traversing at their own speed, the meeting point would be somewhere in the cycle.
    - reset fast pointer to start, then traverse one step at a time. the meeting point during this traversal would be the duplicated number.
    
```cpp
int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() < 1) 
        return -1;
     
    
    int slow = nums[0];
    int fast = nums[nums[0]];

    while (slow != fast){
        slow = nums[slow]; 
        fast = nums[nums[fast]]; 
    }
   
    
    slow = 0;
    while (fast != slow){
        fast = nums[fast];
        slow = nums[slow];
    }
    return fast;
}
```
