- shuffling an array will produce a random permutation (one permutation that is equally likely to appear out of all the possible permutations)

```cpp
 vector<int> shuffle() {
    for (int last = curr.size()-1; last >= 0; last--){
        int picked = rand() % (last+1); //to find a random number from 0 to last
        swap(curr[last], curr[picked]);
    }
    return curr;
}
```
