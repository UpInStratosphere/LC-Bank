If we can modify the array, fully utilize the fact that all the values can be "hashed" into its indices.
- each value will either be swapped into its correct index OR skipped if its corresponding index already has such value:
    - if the curr value's corresponding index does not have the curr value, swap it in. So each swap will increase the number of correctly placed index by 1. This index will not be modified again.
    - if the curr value's corresponding index already has the curr value, which means curr value in the current index is a duplicate value. Do nothing (never modify an index that already has a correct value)
    - total correct index + skipped(incorrect) index = total index

```cpp
vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int>res;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        while (nums[i] != nums[nums[i]-1])
            swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]);
    }
    
    //in the end, all duplicate values will be in a wrong index (they replaced those missing values)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if (nums[i] != i+1)
            res.push_back(nums[i]);
    }
    return res;
}
```
