- use the index of the numbers as the hash key to track the first n positive numbers (from 1 to n)

- for each valid value, if its corresponding index (hashkey) does not have such value, then swap this value to that index. and continue swapping until the current value becomes invalid or the corresponding index already has the current value.
    - each valid value (from 1 to n) will be swapped into its index only once, and each invalid value (< 0 or >n) will be skipped if visited.

- so the amortized time will be O(N) even if some loop will execute more than O(1)

```cpp
int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 1;
    int n = nums.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int curr = nums[i];
        while (1 <= curr && curr <= n && curr != nums[curr-1]){
            swap(nums[i], nums[curr-1]);
            curr = nums[i];
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if (nums[i] != i + 1)
            return i + 1;
    }
    
    //if here, then that means we have all the positive integers from 1 to n
    return n+1;
    }
```
