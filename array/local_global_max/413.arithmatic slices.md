Brute force:
- create N^2 subarrays and check each subarray independently and separately.
- does not re-use any of the previous work.

Optimized
- Similar to 978, each new element can be a new end that creates curr+1 new slices in the current window OR start a new slice
- curr is the number of new valid slices created by the curr number as the end (each of the prev valid slices has a new end)
- res is the cumulative number of valid slices


```cpp
 int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& A) {
    if (A.empty()) return 0;
    int n = A.size(), curr = 0, res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        //no need to check all pair diff, must be true by induction
        if (i >= 2 && (A[i] - A[i-1]) == A[i-1] - A[i-2]){ 
            curr+=1;
            res+=curr;
        }
        else
            curr = 0;
    }
    return res;       
}
```
