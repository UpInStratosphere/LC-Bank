for each of the number, use it as the end of a new subarray
- if prev subarray has a negative sum, excluding it from the current subarray is always better for the current subarray than including it. Including it does not lead to a larger sum for any later subarray that includes the current subarray.
- prev subarray always include the prev element, so prev element is either included with the current element in the current subarray or it is dropped.

```cpp
int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;
    int curr = 0, res = INT_MIN;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        curr = max(curr+nums[i], nums[i]);
        res = max(res, curr);
    }
    return res;
}
```
