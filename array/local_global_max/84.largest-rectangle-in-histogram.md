- use each itself as the height of a rectangle, and find the max width that can be used with the current height.
    - the width is bounded by the first left and right height that are smaller than the current height
        - every height in between is >= current height, so current height can be substituted for their value when calculating the area of the current rectangle.
- max of local max is the global max
        
- brute force:
    - for each height, expand left and right until the values are smaller than current. (N^2)
- optimized:
    - use monotonic stack and scan once forward and once backward to find the first height smaller than current height. 
    
```cpp
 if (heights.empty()) return 0;
    stack<int>stk1, stk2;
    int n = heights.size(), res = 0;
    vector<int>left_small(n, 0), right_small(n,0);
    //the rectangle area is bounded by the smaller height on both sides of each height
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        while (!stk1.empty() && heights[stk1.top()] >= heights[i])
            stk1.pop();

        if (!stk1.empty())
            left_small[i] = stk1.top();
        else
            left_small[i] = -1; 

        stk1.push(i);
    }
    //find the closest right element that is smaller
    //when everything to the right is smaller, assign n as the next larger index
    for (int j = n-1; j >= 0; j--){
        while (!stk2.empty() && heights[stk2.top()] >= heights[j])
            stk2.pop();
        if (!stk2.empty())
            right_small[j] = stk2.top();
        else
            right_small[j] = n;
        stk2.push(j);
    }

    //find how many bars are btw the left and right indices
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++){
        int curr = heights[k] * (right_small[k] - left_small[k] - 1);
        res = max(curr, res);
    }
    return res;
}
```
