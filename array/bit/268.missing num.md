- value has n unique numbers (ranges from 0 to n)
- index has n unique numbers (ranges from 0 to n-1)
- if we create an extra variable with value n, then it can be thought as an extra index : the indices will now have all n+1 numbers and the remaining index that does not get cancelled by a value will be the missing number.

```cpp
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size(), res = n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        res ^= nums[i] ^ i;
    return res;
}
```
