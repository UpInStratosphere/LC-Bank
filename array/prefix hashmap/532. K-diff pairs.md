For each num, only need to check to see if num+k exists in the hashmap
- since abs diff is k, meaning the pair will have a smaller and larger number, so by only counting when the curr is the smaller number, we don't have to worry about double counting the same pair later when we encounter the bigger number that was matched with the curr number.

```cpp
int findPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (nums.empty() || k < 0) return 0;
    
    int res = 0;
    unordered_map<int,int>freq;
    
    for (int num : nums)
        freq[num]++;

    for (auto element : freq){
        int curr = element.first;
        if (k == 0 && element.second >= 2)
            res+=1;
        else if (k > 0 && freq.find(curr+k) != freq.end())
            res+=1;
    }
    return res;
}
```
