- optimization comes from sorting 
    - if curr triplet >= target, don't check for the nums already eliminated by prev second since curr second > prev second, if sum with the prev second > target, then with curr second is also > target.
 
```cpp
int threeSumSmaller(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int len = nums.size();
    int res = 0;
    for (int first = 0; first < len - 2 ; first++){
        int second = first+1, third = len-1;
        while(second < third){
            if (nums[first] + nums[second] + nums[third] < target){
                res += (third-second); 
                second++; 
            }
            else{ //can only change third (since incrementing second will increase curr sum)
                third--;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
