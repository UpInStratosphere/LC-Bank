Need **unique** trilets (meaning the value combinations in the triplet must be unique) that have a specific sum
    - uniqueness comes from the value of the elements, not the index of the elements
- duplicate values should not be used in the same index in the triplet
- sorting saves time to repeated checks AND allows to skip duplicate values for the triplet indices
    - optimization happens because regardless whether the curr second and curr third works, all the prior seconds don't work with curr third because their sums are too small, and all prior thirds don't with curr second because their sums are too big.


```cpp
vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    vector<vector<int>>res;
    for (int first = 0; first <= n-3; first++){
        if (first > 0 && nums[first] == nums[first-1]) continue;
        int second = first+1, third = n-1;
        while(second < third){
            int sum = nums[first] + nums[second] + nums[third];
            if (sum == 0){
                res.push_back({nums[first], nums[second], nums[third]});
                second++;
                third--;
                while(second < third && nums[second] == nums[second-1])
                    second++;
                while(second < third && nums[third] == nums[third+1])
                    third--;
            }
            else if (sum < 0)
                second++;
            else
                third--;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
