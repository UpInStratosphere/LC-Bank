- valid triangle : a + b > c
- for each num scanned from the back as the third num: for each num used as the second in the triplet, find all the first num that can be used in the triplet 
    - optimization comes from sorting:
        - no need to re-check those first that did not work with the prev second because prev second is > curr second, if those did not work with the prev second, the sum with curr second is even smaller, hence will definitely does not work.
```cpp
int triangleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() < 3) return 0;
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int res = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int third = n-1; third >= 2; third--){
        int first = 0, second = third-1;
        while(first < second){
            if (nums[first] + nums[second] > nums[third]){
                res += second-first;
                second--;
            }
            else{ 
                first++;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
