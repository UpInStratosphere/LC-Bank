- the data only stores unique numbers, and get random must return each number with equal probability
    - the vector is only used to store the numbers, keeping numbers in a sequential manner is not 
- swap and overwrite the deleted number with the last number in the vector
- need to choose vector over list because random function generates a number that can be used as the index, and list cannot be used to directly access an element via the the number generated.

- update the swapped num's index BEFORE the deleted num in the hashmap Because the deleted number may be the last number in the vector, so swapping does nothing since that number will be removed.

```cpp
bool insert(int val) {
    if (entry.find(val) != entry.end()) return false;
    nums.push_back(val);
    entry[val] = nums.size()-1;
    return true;
}

bool remove(int val) {
    if(entry.find(val) == entry.end()) return false;
    
    //find
    int index = entry[val];
    int end_val = nums.back();
    
    //overwrite
    nums[index] = end_val;
    entry[end_val] = index;
    
    //delete
    nums.pop_back();
    entry.erase(val);
    
    return true;
}

int getRandom() {
    int index = rand() % nums.size();
    return nums[index];
}
```
