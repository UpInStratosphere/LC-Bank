- the data only stores unique numbers, and get random must return each number with equal probability
    - the vector is only used to store the numbers, keeping numbers in a sequential manner is not 
- swap and overwrite the deleted number with the last number in the vector
- need to choose vector over iterator because random function needs to generate a position to be used as the index, and list cannot be used to directly access an element via the position position at O(1) speed.

- update the swapped num's index BEFORE the deleted num in the hashmap Because the deleted number may be the last number in the vector, so swapping does nothing as that number will be removed from both the hashmap and data

```cpp
bool insert(int val) {
    if (entry.find(val) != entry.end()) return false;
    nums.push_back(val);
    entry[val] = nums.size()-1;
    return true;
}

bool remove(int val) {
    if(entry.find(val) == entry.end()) return false;
    
    //swap and overwrite the deleted number with the last number
    int target_index = entry[val];
    int swapped_val = nums.back();
    nums[target_index] = swapped_val;
    nums.pop_back();
    
    //update the swapped num  before  the deleted num in the hashmap since the del num may be the last one
    entry[swapped_val] = target_index;
    entry.erase(val);
    
    return true;
}

int getRandom() {
    int index = rand() % nums.size();
    return nums[index];
}
```
