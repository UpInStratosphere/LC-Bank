Hashmap method uses extra space because we are tracking all element's freq instead of only the majority candidates freq

boyer moore 
- uses local variables to track and store current majority element's candidate and their frequency
- each new element is either added/assigned to the current candidate freq OR cancel out the current candidate

New element is checked with the existing candidate first BEFORE assigning to empty slots to prevent assigning the same element to different candidates


```cpp

vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int>res;
    if (nums.empty()) return res;
    int first = 0, second = 0, count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int num : nums){
        if (num == first || num == second){
            if (num == first)
                count1++;
            else
                count2++;
        }
        else if (count1 == 0 || count2 == 0){
            if (count1 == 0){
                first = num;
                count1 = 1;
            }
            else{
                second = num;
                count2 = 1;
            }
        }
        else{
            count1--;
            count2--;
        }
    }

    count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums){
        if (num == first)
            count1++;
        else if (num == second)
            count2++;
    }

    if (count1 > n/3) res.push_back(first);
    if (count2 > n/3) res.push_back(second);
    return res;
}
```
