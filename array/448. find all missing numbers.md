in-place modification with index as hashkey for value only works because the values are from 1 to n, so they can be matched with the index from 0 to n-1
- continously swap the index with the correct place where a value could be placed in.


```cpp
vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int>res;
    int n = nums.size();
    //for each value that can be placed in its index, placed it in there
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        while (nums[i] >= 1 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i])
            swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if (nums[i] != i+1)
            res.push_back(i+1);
    }
    return res;
}
```
