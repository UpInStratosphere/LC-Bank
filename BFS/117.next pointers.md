- if use BFS with queue, connect each node in the current level as we pop them from the queue.
    - queue will take O(N) in space
- if we use smart pointer and use connected top nodes to traverse instead of queue, then its O(1).
    - dummy acts as the dummy head node for each level's connected nodes
    - each node is connected to the tail of the current list
    - after the current level is done (no more top nodes), we need to connect next level, so we move the top node to the current level's first node, which is after the dummy node.
    

```cpp
Node *connect(Node *root){
    if (!root) return NULL;
    Node *dummy = new Node(), *tail = dummy, *top = root;
    while(top){
        if (top->left){
            tail->next = tail->left;
            tail = tail->next;
        }
        if (top->right){
            tail->next = top->right;
            tail = tail->next;
        }
        
        if (top->next)
            top = top->next;
        else{
            top = dummy->next;
            dummy->next = NULL;
            tail = dummy;
        }
    }
    delete dummy;
    return root;
}
```
