- many source && many targets
    - the goal is for each source to get to the closest target.
    - brute force: BFS for each source
- for each gate, go to its nearest room with BFS, this ensures that all rooms visited are from its closest gate. 
- do not revisit the rooms that have already been visited, each room will be visited the first time by the closest gate
    - the second time will not result a shorter path (at best it will be the same length)

```cpp
void wallsAndGates(vector<vector<int>>&rooms){
    if (rooms.empty() || rooms[0].empty()) return;
    int row = rooms.size(), col = rooms[0].size();
    queue<pair<int,int>>reach;
    vector<vector<int>>dirs{{1,0}, {-1,0}, {0,1}, {0,-1}};
    for (int i = 0; i < row; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < col; j++){
            if (rooms[i][j] == 0)
                reach.push({i,j});
        }
    }
    
    while (!reach.empty()){
        int r = reach.front().first, c = reach.front().second;
        reach.pop(); //each popped already has its length filled 
        for (auto dir : dirs){
            int x = r + dir[0], y = c + dir[1];
            if (x < 0 || x >= row || y < 0 || y >= col) continue;
            if (rooms[x][y] != INT_MAX) continue;
            rooms[x][y] == rooms[r][c]+1;
            reach.push({x,y});
        }
    }
}
```
