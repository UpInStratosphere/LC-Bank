- many source && many targets
- the goal is for each source to get to the closest target.
- brute force: BFS for each source
    - inefficiency : for the shortest path, each interval node in the shortest path also has its shortest path length calculated but not cached. Instead have to re-calculate for each node, many repeated calculations.
- optimized:
    - do BFS from each gate: find the length for each shortest path from the end node and build each front node with the already saved result. Similar to bottom up DP so each cell only needs to be calculated once.

```cpp
void wallsAndGates(vector<vector<int>>&rooms){
    if (rooms.empty() || rooms[0].empty()) return;
    int row = rooms.size(), col = rooms[0].size();
    queue<pair<int,int>>reach;
    vector<vector<int>>dirs{{1,0}, {-1,0}, {0,1}, {0,-1}};
    
    //start from the end nodes of each shortest path
    for (int i = 0; i < row; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < col; j++){
            if (rooms[i][j] == 0)
                reach.push({i,j});
        }
    }
    
    //each new cell uses previous cell in the the shortest path so each cell is only calculated once
    while (!reach.empty()){
        int n = reach.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            int r = reach.front().first, c = reach.front().second;
            reach.pop(); 
            for (auto dir : dirs){
                int x = r + dir[0], y = c + dir[1];
                if (x < 0 || x >= row || y < 0 || y >= col) continue;
                if (rooms[x][y] != INT_MAX) continue;
                rooms[x][y] == rooms[r][c]+1;
                reach.push({x,y});
            }
        }
    }
}
```
