- each step is via BFS => keep all chars the same while iterate alphabet for curr char, one at a time.
    - ONLY IF such word in the dict has not been visited already by other mutations

- Time complexity: O(min(N, 26^M) * M) where M is the word length and N is the words in dict
    - Determined by the size of the dict, either checks all string length of M, or all dict words
    - At worst each dict word will be in queue and get mutated, result (25 * M) neighbor words 
        - if dict is infinitely large, then all mutation words exist in dict, total of 25^N words.
        - if dict is finite, but source and target are unconnected words, still may exhaust all the words.
        
```cpp
int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
    if (beginWord.size() != endWord.size()) return -1; //negative value is a better indicator for not possible than 0
    if (wordList.empty()) return -1;
    unordered_set<string>dict(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
    if (dict.find(endWord) == dict.end()) return 0;
    unordered_set<string>seen;
    queue<string>same_level;

    //len records the length of the shortest sequence 
    int len = 1; 
    same_level.push(beginWord);
    seen.insert(beginWord);

    while(!same_level.empty()){
        int n = same_level.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){ 
            string curr = same_level.front();
            same_level.pop();
            if (curr == endWord)
                return len;
            mutate(curr, dict, same_level, seen); 
        }
        len++; 
    }
    //if here, transformation is not possible
    return -1;
}
    
 
void mutate(string &curr, const unordered_set<string>&dict, queue<string>&same_level, unordered_set<string>&seen){ 
    for (int i = 0; i < curr.size(); ++i){

        for (int j = 0; j < 26; ++j){ 
            curr[i] = 'a'+ j;
