- each step is one character change
- to determine the number of change steps from the source word, each new word generated should be changed 1 step from the previous word and be found in the dict (otherwise too many words) ONLY IF such word has not been generated (if already been generated, then a shorter steps of change for that word has already been found)
- shortest step: BFS

```cpp
int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
    if (beginWord.size() != endWord.size()) return -1; //negative value is a better indicator for not possible than 0
    if (wordList.empty()) return -1;
    unordered_set<string>dict(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
    if (dict.find(endWord) == dict.end()) return 0;
    unordered_set<string>seen;
    queue<string>same_level;

    //len records the length of the shortest sequence 
    int len = 1; 
    same_level.push(beginWord);
    seen.insert(beginWord);

    while(!same_level.empty()){
        int n = same_level.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){ 
            string curr = same_level.front();
            same_level.pop();
            if (curr == endWord)
                return len;
            mutate(curr, dict, same_level, seen); 
        }
        len++; 
    }
    //if here, transformation is not possible
    return -1;
}
    
 
void mutate(string &curr, const unordered_set<string>&dict, queue<string>&same_level, unordered_set<string>&seen){ 
    for (int i = 0; i < curr.size(); ++i){
        char c = curr[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < 26; ++j){ 
            curr[i] = 'a'+ j;
            if (dict.find(curr) != dict.end() && seen.find(curr) == seen.end()){ 
                same_level.push(curr);
                seen.insert(curr);
            }
        }
        curr[i] = c; 
    }
}
```
