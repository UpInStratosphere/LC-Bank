Consecutive groups 
- Need to find how many continuous groups can be formed

time 
- NlogM where M is the number of unique cards from pushing into map
- it would take logM to look up the next value in the current hand, so WlogM each hand.
- if all cards are used (no early termination), then it would be NlogM for all hands.
- total time would be 2NlogM
    - even if we could optimize the time to build each hand to O(N), unless we have a better way to keep the smallest card (which is required to build each hand), sorting each card and tracking their frequency will dominate the overall time.

```cpp
bool isNStraightHand(vector<int>& hand, int W) {
    if (hand.empty()) return false;
    int n = hand.size();
    if (n % W != 0) return false; 
    map<int,int>freq;
    for (int card : hand){
        freq[card]++;
    }
    while(!freq.empty()){
        int start = freq.begin()->first;
        for (int i = 0; i < W; i++){
            if (freq.find(start+i) == freq.end()) return false;
            freq[start+i]--;
            if (freq[start+i] == 0) freq.erase(start+i);
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
