- use concantenated string of start and end station as the key, and map it to the total frequency and time incurred by everyone.
- two hashmaps: one to store currently unfinished trips (commuter still needs to exit), and one to store completed trips.

```cpp
class UndergroundSystem {
private:
    unordered_map<string, pair<int, int>>trips; // trips : [TotalTime, frequency] //hashmap for all completed trips
    unordered_map<int, pair<string, int>>person; // Uid : [StationName, Time] //person who only checked in
public:
    UndergroundSystem() {
    //no need to initialize anything since both hashmaps will be empty upon initialization
    }
    
    void checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t) { //starts the trip
        person[id] = {stationName, t};
    }
    
    void checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t) { //completes the trip
        string starting_station= starting[id].first;
        int checkIn_time = starting[id].second;
        string route = starting_station + "_" + stationName;
        trips[route].first += t - checkIn_time;
        trips[route].second += 1;
    }
    
    double getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation) {
        string route = startStation + "_" + endStation;
        int total_time = trips[route].first, freq = trips[route].second;
        return (double) total_time / freq;
    }
};
```
