- logic
  - To get a continuous subarray product, we always have to include the current element in the current subarray(cannot skip it), So either use the previous continuous subarray, OR start a new subarray with the new element. 
  - each min/max product refers to the subarray product UP to the current element (including the current element).
  - Additional operation: to address the special case when the current element is negative, we would need to swap the current min and max value before we proceed with the operation. 
  - DP recurrence relation
    - local_max[i] = max(local_max[i-1] + curr[i], curr[i]) //must include the current element to get the local max, so our choice is either to take all of the previous, or do not take any of the previous and start over
    - global_max[i] = max(global_max[i-1], local_max[i]) //the total global max must either include the new loval max in consideration OR do not include. 

- code below
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        int res = INT_MIN;
        int curr_min = 1, curr_max = 1;
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            if (nums[i] < 0)
                swap(curr_min, curr_max);
            curr_min = min(curr_min*nums[i], nums[i]);
            curr_max = max(curr_max*nums[i], nums[i]);
            res = max(res, curr_max);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
