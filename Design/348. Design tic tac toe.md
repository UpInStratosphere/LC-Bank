Class initialize an n by n grid, and has 4 methods

intuitive : O(N) time for each move function
    - move function (moves and determines if any player wins the game after such move)
    - check function (used as a helper function in the move function)
        - check vertical and horizontal are both easy to check
        - for a diagnal to work, only two situations
            - from left to right : each cell in the path must be row == col
            - from right to left : each cell in the path must be row == n - col - 1;
    

optimized: O(1) check for each move
    - keep a counter vector for each row and col, and since are there only 2 players, can use the cumulative result for the moved row and col to check if that row or col is made up of one player only.
    - keep 2 separate variables for 2 diagnals and update after each move
