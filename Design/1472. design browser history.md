- mimics real browser history:
    - Need to maintain visited order,so use a sequential container to store all the different urls
    - each new page is added to the front of the list (easier to code the iterator)
        - Go backwards in history, increase the current page iterator (move toward the back of the list)
        - Go forwards in history, decrese the current page iterator (move toward the front of the list)
    - If the curr page is already the desired visiting page, we do not create a new item in history
    - potential follow up: code a class function to review the  browser history and delete specific history
- list is the best DS to use
    - store duplicate urls in the history (as long as they are not consecutive)
    - scale with additional deletion functionalities
  
```cpp
class BrowserHistory {
private:
    list<string>history;
    list<string>::iterator tab;
public:
    BrowserHistory(string homepage) {
        history.push_front(homepage);
        tab = history.begin();
    }
    
    void visit(string url) { 
        if (*tab == url) return; 
        history.erase(history.begin(),tab); //does not delete curr page
        history.push_front(url);
        tab = history.begin();
    }
    
    string back(int steps) { 
        if (tab == --history.end()) 
            return *--history.end();
        
        while(steps > 0){
            --steps;
            ++tab;
            if (tab == --history.end()) 
                return *--history.end();
        }
        return *tab;
    }
    
    string forward(int steps) { 
        if (tab == history.begin()) 
            return *history.begin();
        
        while(steps>0){
            --steps;
            --tab;
            if (tab == history.begin())
                return *history.begin();
        }    
        return *tab;  
    }
    
    //specific function that delete specific url while maintaining the visited order of other urls
    void deleteHistory(string url){
        auto curr = history.begin();
        while (curr != history.end()){
            if (*curr == url)
                history.erase(curr);
            curr++;
        }
    }
};
```
