Iterator is used as a method to get the next larger number without using any traversal algorithm (the inorder traversal is encapsulated in the method itself)
    - brute force would be traverse the entire tree and store all nodes in a vector and each iterator would call the next index
    - better solution is that for each has next function, just store the next one in the container and no more than necessary
        - each next function would return the curr number and makes sure that the next one is callable 
        - this would save space from O(N) to O(H) since stack at most saves one branch in the stack only
    - next larger is either in the right subtree (which would need to be pushed in stack) OR found in the upper layer, which is already in stack and nothing needs to be done 
    

```cpp
class BSTIterator {
private:
    stack<TreeNode*>stk;
public:
    BSTIterator(TreeNode* root) {
        while(root){
            stk.push(root);
            root = root->left;
        }
    }
    
    /** @return the next smallest number */
    int next() {
        auto curr = stk.top();
        stk.pop();
        auto temp = curr->right; 
        while(temp){ //only need to do so if there is a right subtree (next larger would be in the right subtree)
            stk.push(temp);
            temp = temp->left;
        }
        return curr->val;
    }
    
    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    bool hasNext() {
        return !stk.empty();
    }
};
