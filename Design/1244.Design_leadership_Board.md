- TopK problem where the topK function may be called often and each key's freq is updated often.
    - freq(score) for each key can be increased and decreased, so using heap to store the topK freq is not optimized since we may need to delete items within the heap 
    - topK is called often, so using quick select to sort players based on their freq for each call with O(N) is not efficient.

- optimized:
    - use hashmap to to store [player: score], and treem map [score : vector of players]
    - so we can update the score for each player at LogN time, and topK is only K time.

```cpp
class Leaderboard {
private:
    unordered_map<int,int>player_score; 
    map<int, unordered_set<int>>topK; //keep the players sorted according to their scores
    
public:
    Leaderboard() {
        entry = {};
        topK = {};
    }
    
    void addScore(int playerId, int score) { // logN
        if (player_score.find(playerId) != player_score.end()){
            int old_score = player_score[playerId];
            topK[old_score].erase(playerId);
            if (topK[old_score].empty()) 
                topK.erase(old_score);
            
            player_score[playerId] += score;
            int new_score = player_score[playerId];
            topK[new_score].insert(playerId);
        }
        else{
            player_score[playerId] = score;
            topK[score].insert(playerId);
        }
        /* because K may be different each call, cannot keep the treemap of scores to K size. 
        // If it is the same each call, then can always keep it K size.
        // at worst there are only 1 player per each score. Insertion time is logK

        }
        */
    }
