- Essentially a topK problem where the topK function may be called often.
    - if we know topK function is only called once, then this is the same problem as 347, where we can just use one hashmap of players and their scores and do a quick partition based on the players score whenever topK is called. O(N) where N is the unique players
    - but if topK function is called multiple times, then we need to think about the **trade off** between optimizing topK(read) function and the write(update) functions.

- if topK is called many times, having it at best O(N) time is too slow.
    - use separate data structures to store [player: score], and [score : players]
    - update player score and keeping all players sorted in each write function, and topK read function only needs to read from the back of the sorted players by their scores.

```cpp
class Leaderboard {
private:
    unordered_map<int,int>player_score; 
    map<int, unordered_set<int>>topK; //keep the players sorted according to their scores
    
public:
    Leaderboard() {
        entry = {};
        topK = {};
    }
    
    void addScore(int playerId, int score) { // logN
        if (player_score.find(playerId) != player_score.end()){
            int old_score = player_score[playerId];
            topK[old_score].erase(playerId);
            if (topK[old_score].empty()) 
                topK.erase(old_score);
            
            player_score[playerId] += score;
            int new_score = player_score[playerId];
            topK[new_score].insert(playerId);
        }
        else{
            player_score[playerId] = score;
            topK[score].insert(playerId);
        }
        /* because K may be different each call, cannot keep the treemap of scores to K size. 
        // If it is the same each call, then can always keep it K size.
        // at worst there are only 1 player per each score. Insertion time is logK
        while (topK.size() > K){
            auto it = topK.begin();
            int key = it->first;
            for (auto player : it->second){
                entry[player] = 0;
            }
            topK.erase(key);
        }
        */
    }
    
    int top(int K) { // O(K) since we are only using iterators to get topK from the back
        int count = K;
        int res = 0;
        for (auto it = topK.rbegin(); count > 0 && it != topK.rend(); it++){
            int top_score = it->first;
            int total = it->second.size(); 
            while (count > 0 && total > 0){
                res += top_score;
                total--;
                count--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    void reset(int playerId) { //logN
        int old_score = entry[playerId];
        entry[playerId] = 0;
        topK[old_score].erase(playerId);
        if(topK[old_score].empty())
            topK.erase(old_score);
        topK[0].insert(playerId); //if everyone have 0 score in the end, then return random K people
    }
};
