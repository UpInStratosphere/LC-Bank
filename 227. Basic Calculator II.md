Logic
- we use a variable to store the operator prior to the current operator, so when the current element is an operator (each operation requires 2 operands, so we will need to track both the first and the second operands for each operation), we can perform operation associated with the previous operator.
- we have to do the first traversal to take care of operations of x and /. Then do another stack traversal to finish the operation for addition and subtraction.
- Because we have not yet visited the second required operand for the current operator, we have to wait until we encounter the next operator, that's when we know current stored integer is for the previous operator.
- After we finish executing operation associated with the previous operator, we push the result back into the stack BECAUSE there is a chance that the result will be used for the next operator (e.g. 3 + 4/5 * 6)
- at the last element (whether it is a space or integer, we know it won't be a sign because we know that the string is valid. If the last element is a sign, then the string is invalid), we have to remember to execute the operation associated with the last operator saved.
