- Logic
  - same logic as isomorphic strings. Extra procedure to turn the words into a vector of words first for easier processing. 
  - **Core procedure is to assign each letter/word's initial value to -1**. 
  - For each iteration, we first check whether after the existing mapped latest index in the hashmaps are the same (the index updated from the previous iteration). Then we can assign the current index to each respective items. There is always an index to compare each char/letter. 
    - when both items are new, their existing indices are the same. So it is currently true.
    - when both items have been updated, their existing indices should be the same if they match. If not, it means one item has been updated when the other did not, OR one of item is now currently being mapped to a new item, which still has its initial value of -1.
- code sample
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool wordPattern(string pattern, string str) {
        stringstream strcin(str); //pass the str into the stringstream
        string s;
        vector<string>words;
        while(strcin >> s) words.push_back(s);
        if (pattern.size() != words.size()) return false;
        unordered_map<string, int>words_map;
        for (auto word: words)
            words_map[word] = -1;
        unordered_map<char, int>letters_map;
        for (auto letter: pattern)
            letters_map[letter] = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            string word = words[i];
            char letter = pattern[i];
            if (words_map[word] != letters_map[letter]) return false;
            words_map[word] = i;
            letters_map[letter] = i;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
