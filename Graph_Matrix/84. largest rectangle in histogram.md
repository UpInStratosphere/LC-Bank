For each height, use it as the height of the rectangle
- the width would be all the continuous that are >= the current height, which means it is the number of heights between the prev and next smaller height.
- brute force would be scanning front and back for each height.
- use monotonic stack + save those height's index would save the repeated scanning for each element

```cpp
int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
    if (heights.empty()) return 0;
    stack<int>stk1, stk2;
    vector<int>left_small(n, 0), right_small(n,0);
    int n = heights.size(), res = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        while (!stk1.empty() && heights[stk1.top()] >= heights[i])
            stk1.pop();

        if (!stk1.empty())
            left_small[i] = stk1.top();
        else
            left_small[i] = -1; 

        stk1.push(i);
    }

    for (int j = n-1; j >= 0; j--){
        while (!stk2.empty() && heights[stk2.top()] >= heights[j])
            stk2.pop();
        if (!stk2.empty())
            right_small[j] = stk2.top();
        else
            right_small[j] = n;
        stk2.push(j);
    }

    //the rectangle area is bounded by the smaller height on both sides 
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++){
        int curr = heights[k] * (right_small[k] - left_small[k] - 1);
        res = max(curr, res);
    }

    return res;
}
```
