- If a node has 0 indegree, then it has no dependency, so it can be visited BEFORE the rest 
- edges can only be formed btw consecutive words, as the relative order can only be determined by the first character that's different between the 2 consecutively sorted words

```cpp
string alienOrder(vector<string>& words) {
    if (words.size() == 0) return "";
    unordered_map<char, int> indegree;
    unordered_map<char, unordered_set<char>> graph;

    // initialize an indegree map for all unique letters. If they don't have edges, then they can be put anywhere in the sorted sequence. 
    // O(N*M) time complexity
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < words[i].size(); j++) {
            char c = words[i][j];
            indegree[c] = 0;
            graph[c] = {};
        }
    }

    //use the sorted consecutive words to build dependency relations (edges) between unique characters
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size() - 1; i++) {
        string curr = words[i];
        string next = words[i + 1];
        int len = min(curr.size(), next.size()); 
        for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {
            if (curr[j] != next[j]) {
                if (graph[curr[j]].find(next[j]) == graph[curr[j]].end()){
                    graph[curr[j]].insert(next[j]); 
                    indegree[next[j]]++; 
                }
                break; 
            }
        }
    }

    //topological sort
    string ans;
    queue<char> q;
    for (auto &e : indegree) { 
        if (e.second == 0) {
            q.push(e.first);
        }
    }
    while(!q.empty()) { 
        char cur = q.front();
        q.pop();
        ans.push_back(cur); 

        for (auto &e : graph[cur]) { 
            indegree[e]--;
            if (indegree[e] == 0) {
                q.push(e);
            }
        }            
    }

    //if not a DAG, then the sorted nodes count would be different than the total nodes count 
    //A VALID sorted sequence among the unique characters is not possible 
    return ans.length() < indegree.size() ? "" : ans; 
}


// time complexity is dominated by the O(N*M) when finding all vertices in the current graph
