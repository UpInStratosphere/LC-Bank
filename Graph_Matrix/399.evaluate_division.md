- the variables have both symmetric and transitive property based on the equations. 
- build a directed weighted graph, and for each query use DFS determine if the there is a path from the src to dst
    - To build the graph, we need O(E) where E is the number of equations
    - for each Query, we would at most traverse the entire graph O(V+E) where V is the total number of variables in graph and         edges are the equations given
- total time is O(E) + O(N * (V+E))

```cpp
vector<double> calcEquation(vector<vector<string>>& equations, vector<double>& values, vector<vector<string>>& queries) {

    for (int i = 0; i < equations.size(); ++i) {
        string A = equations[i][0];
        string B = equations[i][1];
        double k = values[i];
        graph[A][B] = k;
        graph[B][A] = 1.0 / k;
    }

    //need to insert the curr node BEFORE recursing instead of AFTER (unlike DP) because of the possible cycled paths formed from the current node, any cycled path is invalid
