- Use backtracking to visit all the paths BECAUSE different parent nodes can lead to the same suffix paths that lead to target node and result different paths. Worst case all paths are valid paths. 
- DFS + memo can be used as well, even though it does not change the asymptotic time comeplexity

-Backtracking: O(2^N) where total node visit times will be 2^N times.
```cpp
void helper(vector<vector<int>>&graph, int curr, int target, vector<int>&path, vector<vector<int>>&res, unordered_set<int>&visited){
    if (visited.find(curr) != visited.end()) return;

    path.push_back(curr);
    visited.insert(curr);

    if (curr == target)
        res.push_back(path);
    else{ 
        for (int nei : graph[curr]){
            helper(graph, nei, target, path, res, visited);
        }
    }
    //when here, all paths are already all finished, we are just resetting the visited status
    visited.erase(curr);
    path.pop_back();
}
```
- DFS + memo: O(2^N) * N due to possible 2^N paths construction, but each node only will be traversed once
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        if (graph.empty()) return vector<vector<int>>{};
        unordered_map<int, vector<vector<int>>>memo; //each node stores all the paths it has to the target node
        return helper(graph, 0, memo);
    }
    
vector<vector<int>> helper(const vector<vector<int>>&graph, int curr, unordered_map<int,vector<vector<int>>>&memo){
    //if node has not been processed, then it will not be found in the memo
    if (memo.find(curr) != memo.end())
        return memo[curr];

    vector<vector<int>>res;
    if (curr == graph.size()-1){
        vector<int>temp = {curr};
        res.push_back(temp);
    }
    else{
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[curr].size(); i++){
            vector<vector<int>>paths = helper(graph, graph[curr][i], memo);
            for (auto path : paths){
                path.insert(path.begin(), curr);
                res.push_back(path);
            }
        }
    }
    memo[curr] = res;
    return res;
}
```
- if asked for total number of paths from source to target, use DFS + memo
    - memo[node] : total paths from the node to target node
    - initialze all memo[node] = -1 to indicate that this node has not be processed

```cpp
int DFS(graph, int curr, int dst, unordered_map<int, int>memo){
    if (memo[curr] != -1) return memo[curr];
    if (curr==dst) return 1; 
    
    int res = 0;
    for (int neighbor : graph[curr]){
        int temp = DFS(graph, neighbor, dst, memo);
        res += temp;
    }
    memo[curr] = res;
    return res;
}
```
