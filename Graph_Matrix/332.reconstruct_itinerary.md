- logic is similar to topological sort for a DAG
    - could have cycles
    - could have duplicate edges
    
- for a node to be included in the final path, we must exhaust all of its outgoing paths 
    - first exhausted node will be the last node of the path. 
    - Nodes with more outgoing degrees should be at the front of the path, so all the edges will be visited.

- using a stack implementation
    - if a node has no more outoging edges, can remove this node from further consideration and add to the path
    - else, use DFS to remove each existing neighbor node sequentially and push the neighbor node in stack
- the same node can be used multiple times in the final path vector
- for each node's outgoing edges, store the neighbor nodes in multiset(can store duplicate edges and sorted fashion)

```cpp
vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
    if (tickets.empty()) return vector<string>{};
    vector<string>res;
    unordered_map<string,multiset<string>>graph; //to handle duplicate edges (so may have the same neighbors)
    for (auto ticket : tickets){
        graph[ticket[0]].insert(ticket[1]);
    }
    stack<string>stk;
    stk.push("JFK");
    while(!stk.empty()){
        string curr = stk.top();
        if (graph[curr].empty()){
            res.push_back(curr);
            stk.pop();
        }
        else{
            stk.push(*graph[curr].begin());
            graph[curr].erase(graph[curr].begin());
        }
    }
    reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
    return res;
}
```
