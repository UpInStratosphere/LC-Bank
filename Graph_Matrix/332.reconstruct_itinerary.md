- logic is similar to topological sort for a directed graph
    - could have cycles
    - could have duplicate edges
    
- for a node to be included in the final path, we must exhaust all of its outgoing paths 
    - first exhausted node  will be the first node added into the path. 

- using a stack implementation
    - if a node has no more neighbors, then all of the outgoing edges associated with this node is visited, can remove this node and add it into the path
    - if a node has more outgoing edges, remove the current other end of the edge BEFORE pushing the end node into the stack.
- the same node can be used multiple times in the final path vector
- for each node's outgoing edges, store the dst nodes in multiset(can store duplicate edges in sorted fashion)to represent each outgoing edge for the curr node. 

```cpp
vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
    if (tickets.empty()) return vector<string>{};
    vector<string>res;
    unordered_map<string,multiset<string>>graph;
    for (auto ticket : tickets){
        graph[ticket[0]].insert(ticket[1]);
        if (graph.find(ticket[1]) == graph.end())
            graph[ticket[1]] = {};
    }
    stack<string>stk;
    stk.push("JFK");
    while(!stk.empty()){
        string curr = stk.top();
        if (graph[curr].empty()){
            res.push_back(curr);
            stk.pop();
        }
        else{
            stk.push(*graph[curr].begin());
            graph[curr].erase(graph[curr].begin());
        }
    }
    reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
    return res;
}
```
