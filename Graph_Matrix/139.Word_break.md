- DP can be depicted as a tree with each node can have multiple parents and the root node as the original string 
    - each node is the remaining string to be broken down (depicted by the index of the first char in the original string)
    - leaf node is the when the remaining string is empty
    - function's goal is to see if there is a path from the root to leaf node

- Because multiple different parent nodes (longer remaining substring) can to lead to the same current node (shorter remaining substring) and the answer for whether the current node is able to reach the leaf node is calculated from the bottom (checking all the shorter substrings), we can cache the current string's answer before returning to the upper level(longer substring level) so we don't re-calculate the same node over and over again for different parent nodes (the answers for the shorter string will not change since we can only go from top to bottom for trees).

```cpp
    bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        unordered_map<int, bool>memo;
        unordered_set<string>my_dict;
        for (string word : wordDict)
            my_dict.insert(word);
        return DFS(s, 0, my_dict, memo);
    }
    
//memo[index] whether the string from index to end can be broken down
//each memo have to have a way to distinguish not yet checked and the different answers for after checking
//index is the starting index of the current remaining string
bool DFS(const string &s, int index, const unordered_set<string>&my_dict, unordered_map<int,bool>&memo){
    if (index == s.size()) return true;
    if (memo.find(index) != memo.end()) return memo[index];

    for (int i = index; i < s.size(); i++){
        string prefix = s.substr(index,i-index+1); 
        if (my_dict.find(prefix) != my_dict.end()){ 
            if (DFS(s, i+1, my_dict, memo)) {
                memo[index] = true;
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    memo[index] = false;
    return false;
}
```
