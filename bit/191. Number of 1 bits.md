Bit manipulation:
- n & n-1 will set the least significant bit in n to 0.
- so each iteration set n to the new number of (n & n-1)

```cpp
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (n != 0){ //as long as n is not 0, there are bits that are 1, so repeatedly set the last signficant bit to 0.
        n &= (n-1);
        sum++;
    }
    return sum;
}
```
