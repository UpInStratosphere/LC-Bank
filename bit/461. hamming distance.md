Hamming distance = the bit positions that are different between 2 numbers.
- XOR both numbers will result a number that is composed of differing bits at their respective locations.
    - 0 ^ 0 || 1 ^ 1 == 0
    - 1 ^ 0 || 0 ^ 1 == 1
- use hamming weight on the resulting number to count all the bits that are 1 by doing num & num-1 (32 bit per integer)

```cpp
int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
    int bits = 0;
    int temp = x ^ y;
    while (temp != 0){
        temp &= temp-1;
        bits++;
    }
    return bits;
}
```
