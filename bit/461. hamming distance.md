Hamming distance = the bit positions that are different between 2 numbers.
- XOR both numbers will result a number that is composed of differing bits at their respective locations.
    - 0 ^ 0 || 1 ^ 1 == 0
    - 1 ^ 0 || 0 ^ 1 == 1
- use hamming weight on the resulting number to count all the bits that are 1 by doing num & num-1 (32 bit per integer)

```cpp
vector<int> countBits(int num) {
    vector<int>res(num+1, 0);;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++){
        res[i] = hammingWeight(i);
    }
    return res;
}

int hammingWeight(int curr){
    int weight = 0;
    while (curr != 0){
        curr &= curr-1;
        weight++;
    }
    return weight;
}
```
