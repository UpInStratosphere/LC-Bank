Given all the numbers are unique and are from 0 to n
- use the index (0 to n-1) + an extra n as a different set of numbers that contains the missing number.
- XOR all numbers and the indices to get the missing number.

```cpp
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size(), res = n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        res ^= nums[i] ^ i;

    return res;
}
```
