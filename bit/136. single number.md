Since each number appearred twice, XOR each other with the extra number that only appeared once will get the number itself.
- XOR against 0 will produce the number itself, so initialize the result to 0.

```cpp
 int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {   
    int res = 0;
    for (int num : nums)
        res ^= num;
    return res;
}
```
