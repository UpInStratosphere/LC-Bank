Run hamming weight function for each number (ignoring DP)
- each integer only has 32 bits, so max possible resetting would be 32

```cpp
vector<int> countBits(int num) {
    vector<int>res(num+1, 0);;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++){
        res[i] = helper(i);
    }
    return res;
}

int helper(int curr){
    int weight = 0;
    while (curr != 0){
        curr &= curr-1;
        weight++;
    }
    return weight;
}
```
