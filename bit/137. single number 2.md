Need to use something other than hashmap to represent the state of the numbers (how many times a number appeared)

use bit mask to present the state from  00 => 01 => 10 => 00
- where the state goes from 2 to 0 once we hit 3 times because all numbers need to reach the 0 state so we can use XOR against the extra number 
- use two bit as states for seen once, seen twice, and seen thrice
  - when all numbers are calculated and return 0 for the first state, the extra number XOR first state will return the number
    - first time : seenOnce becomes the number, seenTwice is unchanged and stays 
    - second time: seenOnce becomes 0, and seenTwice becomes the number
    - third time : because seenTwice is the number, seenOnce is stays 0, and seenTwice becomes 0 after bit flipping
  - So in the end, SeenOnce is the number that appeared once only, and seentwice is 0

```cpp
int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int seenOnce = 0, seenTwice = 0;
    for (auto num : nums){
        seenOnce = ~seenTwice & (seenOnce ^ num);
        seenTwice = ~seenOnce & (seenTwice ^ num);
    }
    return seenOnce; 
}
```
