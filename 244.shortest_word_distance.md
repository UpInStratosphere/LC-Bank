-core question is to find the min diff between 2 sorted lists with elements from each.
  - whenever one element is smaller than the other in the comparison pair, increment the pointer to the next one after the smaller element and find new difference. Because a difference between the next one after the bigger one will be bigger than the curr difference

```cpp
int res = INT_MAX;
int len1 = pos[word1].size();
int len2 = pos[word2].size();
int i = 0, j = 0; 
while (i < len1 && j < len2){
    res = min(res, abs(pos[word1][i] - pos[word2][j]));
    if (pos[word1][i] < pos[word2][j]) 
        i++;
    else 
        j++;
}
return res; 
```
