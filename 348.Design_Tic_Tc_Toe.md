- Brute force : for each move inserted, we check the row and col and diagnal line for that cell and see if there is a winning path for the player that just made the move
  - this will result 4N in time, and N^2 in space. (if the board is only 3 by 3. Then time is N^2)
  
```cpp
class TicTacToe {
private:
    vector<vector<int>>grid;
public:
    TicTacToe(int n) {
        grid = vector<vector<int>>(n,vector<int>(n,0));
    }
    
    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        if (row == grid.size() || col == grid[row].size()) return 0; //check for out of boundaries
        if (grid[row][col] != 0) return 0; //check for already used
        grid[row][col] = player == 1 ? 1 : 2;
        if (checkVertical(col, player)) return player;
        if (checkHorizontal(row, player)) return player;
        if (checkDiagnal(row, col, player)) return player;
        return 0;
    }
    
    
    bool checkVertical(int col, int player){
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++){
            if (grid[i][col] != player) 
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    bool checkHorizontal(int row, int player){
        for (int i = 0; i < grid[row].size(); i++){
            if (grid[row][i] != player)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    
    bool checkDiagnal(int row, int col, int player){ 
        if (row != col && (row+col) != grid.size()-1) return false; //curr cell does not have a possible diagnal
        bool topLeftToBottomRight = true;
        bool topRightToBottomLeft = true;
        for (int i=0; i<grid.size(); i++) {
            if (grid[i][i] != player) 
                topLeftToBottomRight = false;
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<grid.size(); i++) {
            if (grid[i][grid.size()-1-i] != player) 
                topRightToBottomLeft = false;
        }
        return topRightToBottomLeft || topLeftToBottomRight;
    }
};
```

- Optimized : use only one row and one column to track whether the total moves made in this row results a winning path for the current player that made the move. To do this, we simply use +1 for one and -1 for another. 
  - However, the biggest problem is that we can't track whether a cell has already been visited with this optimized solution and have to rely on the assumption that each player will make a valid move.
  
```cpp
class TicTacToe {
private:
//count parameter: player 1 +1 : player 2: -1
    vector<int> rowJudge;
    vector<int> colJudge;
    int diag, anti;
    int total;

public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    TicTacToe(int n) {
        rowJudge = vector<int>(n,0);
        colJudge = vector<int>(n,0);
        diag = 0, anti = 0;
        total = n;
    }
    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int add = 0;
        if (player == 1)
            add = 1;
        else
            add = -1;
        
        rowJudge[row] += add;
        colJudge[col] += add;
        if (row == col) 
            diag += add;
        if (row == total - col - 1)
            anti += add;
        
        if(abs(rowJudge[row]) == total || abs(colJudge[col]) == total || abs(diag) == total || abs(anti) == total) 
            return player;
        
        return 0;
    }
};
```
