- Using an iterator to traverse each inner vector: the entire data is like a matrix, for which we will need to return the iterator of each element in each row in sequential order
- there is no multiple levels nested vectors

```cpp
class Vector2D {
private:
    vector<vector<int>>::iterator curr_row, row_end;
    vector<int>::iterator curr_col;
public:
    Vector2D(vector<vector<int>>& v) {
        curr_row = v.begin(), row_end = v.end();
        if (curr_row != row_end)
            curr_col = curr_row->begin(); //curr_col is a pointer to the first element of curr vector(which could be empty)
    }
    
    int next() { 
        if (hasNext())
          return *curr_col++;
        return INT_MIN; //when there is no next element and return INT_MIN as an invalid value
    }
    
    bool hasNext() { //used to check to if there is a next element, but does not increment the iterator
        while (curr_row != row_end && curr_col == curr_row->end()) { //skip possible empty vectors
            ++curr_row;
            if (curr_row != row_end) {
                curr_col = curr_row->begin();
            }  
        }
        return curr_row != row_end;
    }
};
